Generates text based on the lore or patch notes. <br>
Source text can be found in the txt files inside the project. <br>
Patch notes file is not complete, there are only notes from the 2021-2024 updates.<br>

Generates either from a given prompt (`GenerateFrom()`) or from a random beginning (`Generate()`).

Some of my favorite generated bits:
- "when you pulled the vehicle it will despawn as usual"
- "this update is kind of a few failed delivery attempts"
- "this also fixes the problem with oshurs release"
