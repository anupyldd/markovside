In Progress Updates
Normally we would save these types of announcements for the monthly Dev Letter, but since the patch is a little light this week, we've decided to include some more insight into the progress of various updates and fixes in this weeks patch notes.


Sunderer
The Sunderer rework is coming along nicely. We are looking into having it arrive onto the Public Test Server to work out the kinks and adjust some balancing. For the moment we'd like to share some what we have completed.
Here is the look at the reactive armor. The armor is designed to clearly visually indicate, through shape and color, when a piece of reactive armor is active and when it is not.
   

   

   

Some certifications that are not getting a major gameplay overhaul are still receiving visual updates. Below are the new Stealth Module and Enhanced Plating, artwork which replaces Blockade Armor and Mine Guard.
   

   

   



Friends List
The friend's list issue is one area we are focusing on fixing. The tracking server architecture that handles friends lists was breaking down and had to be be almost completely rewritten. Some of the things the rewrite will achieve are:
* Improved database transaction efficiency; i.e. ensuring that everything is immediately saved to database on changes. Previously this happened only a few minutes after the fact and could be lost in cases of reboot/crash/power outage on the server.
* Added automatic consistency fixes; e.g. fixing situations when X is marked as a friend of Y but Y is not marked as friend of X.
* More reliable friends invitation processing; e.g. removing cases when someone sends an invite to be friends and invitee doesn't receive it.
These are just a few of the things we are doing with the rewrite, which should eliminate the vast majority of the bugs the system currently suffers. This is a major overhaul, thus it will be released to the Public Test Server first before being deployed on live. We don't have a firm date on when this will happen but the changes are actively being worked on.


Oshur
There has been much well earned consternation over Oshur. The issues it causes among the game and community are undeniable, but the potential solution for each issue has pros and cons we have to consider carefully.
Generally speaking, our first thoughts are towards building and improving the game. To that end we conducted a systematic review of the continent, which included collating the vast amount of community feedback from many sources. The list of issues was sorted, examined, and we had many discussions around how to solve them. In the end we concluded that although there was promise in the concept, the issues were extremely core to all aspects of Oshur's design from individual bases to the general layout of the continent and lattice. Small changes would do little to solve the issue, and an entire rework was needed.




Unfortunately, we also decided that an entire rework would be a monumental effort the likes of which would detract from other smaller and more pressing issues. Following our philosophy of taking on the most impactful projects first, we saw that Oshur did not make the cut when it came to the effort / impact calculation.




The next logical and simple step would be to simply remove Oshur from the rotation. This presents its own issues though. Oshur has attached to it a large amount of unique content that players have spend their hard earned currency on, as well as unique and interesting directives, missions, and so on. Simply removing it would also create a clump of additional work where we would have to spend a good amount of effort making recompense to players as well as making changes that were deemed "fair" to new and returning players. This is a non-trivial task that would also eat up a surprising amount of resources that are also better spent on more impactful changes.




To that end we decided to take a middle approach. Oshur will be put on an infrequent rotation schedule and a special alert will be created that will more tightly control how long the continent remains active when it does come up. The ability to do this does not currently exist in the rotation scheduling system, and thus we have to design and add it before this change can be made. This is actively being worked on. We will build into the new system the ability to adjust the frequency and up-times of Oshur quickly via data so that adjustments to these parameters can be made relatively quickly and easily. We feel this is a fair compromise to players that never want to deal with Oshur again and those that may want to finish their Dog Tag collection, or take an occasional boat joy ride.




As a bonus side affect we will be adjusting general Warzone rotation such that the same ones don't always follow the same pattern and there will be slight changes in the rotation over time.

                                                                                 Maintenance is now complete. Here are today's hotfix patch notes:

Hello Auraxians! We're kicking off this month's update with some Valentine's Day festivities along with some bug fixes and changes. Check it out below!
Construction Terminal & Key bind changes
* Added a nanite cost (half the static terminal cost) to vehicles spawned from construction terminals. This should throttle the length at which vehicles can be pulled from construction bases at speed by individual players. The Cortium cost remains the same, increasing the overall cost of spawning vehicles from construction terminals.
* There have been changes to the key binds for vehicle utility abilities in preparation for the sunderer rework. This should not affect the current function ("F" still triggers single abilities), but additional slots have been added and can be triggered using the number keys 3-5 by default.

                                                                                 Game servers will go down for our scheduled pc update tomorrow @ 6am pt / 3pm ct. for a 3hr downtime window.


Capture the Conduit Rework
Capture the Conduit has been reworked. Conduit facilities are now "hybrid" style facilities where repositories are activated by Conduits, at which point they become capture points. Attackers must hold these capture points in order to capture the facility in a similar manner to other facilities. Bringing additional flags to a captured repository provides large amounts of capture progress and will greatly speed up capture times. This should make many aspects of capturing a base more readable, familiar, and reliable while still maintaining the more interesting aspects of needing to capture conduits.
How the new system will work:
* Capture the Conduit facilities are captured via the traditional method of holding activated repositories (capture points) until the attacker captures the facility.
* Repositories are activated by bringing conduits to them.
* An activated repository behaves like a normal capture point until the base is captured, or the point is recaptured and deactivated.
* Bringing additional flags to an owned active repository will grant a large amount of facility capture progress, roughly equivalent to owning that point for a minute.
* Conduits themselves will behave the same, and be subject to the same rules and restrictions as they were previously.
Based on feedback from the Public Test Server the capture time was dramatically lowered, especially with the capture of additional flags, which now have a significant impact of capture progress. This should make attacking and capturing a facility easier than it was and also draw some attention towards the flag while a capture is still in progress. That being said, the public test was somewhat limited so we will be making further adjustments as the new system is put through its paces by more players at a higher concurrency.
For a full account of why these changes were made and our though process behind them please see the November 2023 Development Update.






Facilities
As part of the playtest, we are reviewed all 22 of the Conduit facilities. Facilities that remained Conduit bases had updates made to their repository, conduit, and spawn point locations. Other minor adjustments were also made where needed.
Several facility types were also reverted to previous facility types, listed below.
Esamir
The Traverse Reverted to 1 Capture Point
Mattherson's Triumph Reverted to 3 Capture Points
Baldur Amp Station Reverted to 3 Capture Points
Spiral Oasis Reverted to Construction Outpost
Indar
J908 Impact Site Reverted to 3 Capture Points
Indar Excavation Site Reverted to 3 Capture Points
Amerish
The Bastion Reverted to 3 Capture Points
Splitpeak Pass Reverted to 3 Capture Points
West Pass Watchtower Reverted to 3 Capture Points
Hossin
Fort Drexler Reverted to 3 Capture Points
Hunter's Blind
Reverted to 1 Capture Point




Known Issues
The UI still isn't complete and is being actively worked on. The UI should still be functional, but not provide all of the desired information to players for different configurations of the state of the facility. We felt that given the need for the update that releasing with the current UI issues would still be a net positive as opposed to waiting until all of the UI work was fully complete.

-----
Misc. Changes, and Fixes
* Mystery implant description updated to reflect current implant changes.
* Fixed a typo in haunted bastion alert when fleet carrier is destroyed.
* Wavestinger Harpoon now contributes to melee based directives and works with melee implants.
* NSX Fusion Blade now works with Scavenger Implant and contributes towards "Silver for Monsters" Halloween Directive.
* NS Homerun now contributes to melee based directives, including "Silver for Monsters" Halloween Directive.
* Fixed the medical tool being interrupted by players and vehicles. Static collision like walls, roofs, and cover objects will still break line of sight.
* The NS-66 Punisher's Adaptive Underbarrel attachment now correctly fires the grenade of your current class.
* The substantial FPS drop related to shield generators was fixed. It was caused by incorrectly configured and spawned visual effects which have been reimplemented to avoid this issue. The generators should look and work essentially the same without the side effect of making your computer cry.
* MAXes can no longer be revived by grenades. The issue was caused when the player's class would sometimes be changed during the death cam, allowing the now non-MAX MAX to be revived.

* While wielding a beneficial construction module your sprint speed is increased by [7/10/13/15/15]%. At max rank, the time to install beneficial modules is reduced by 50%.
Karma
* Each time you revive an ally a charge is added to Karma. At [30/27/24/20/20] charges, your next death allows you to self-revive once at [50/50/50/50/100]% health. Redeploying or using an equipment terminal will wipe your current progress. Combat Medic only.
Air Drop
* Upon exiting a vehicle Jump Jet recharge rate is increased by [7/7/7/7/10]% for [8/10/12/15/20] seconds. Light Assault only. 30 second cooldown after triggering.
Overcharge
* While overshield is active your primary weapon's bullets will now pierce through one infantry target before stopping. While this implant is equipped your overshield's maximum energy will be reduced by [30/25/20/15/15]%. Heavy Assault only.
Dev Note: A massive thanks to those who tested and provided feedback about these (and other) implants during the weeks they were iterated upon on the Public Test Server. Improvements were made for everything from balancing to names. And while the release may not be perfect, some potentially meta-breaking mistakes were avoided with the invaluable help of our community.




New Construction Targeting Lasers


* Targeting Darts for the Glaive, Flail, and Orbital Strike Uplink have been retired
* Glaive, Flail, and Orbital Strike Uplink now use a Targeting Laser to paint their targets
   * Acquire Time: 3000ms
   * Min Distance (from player): 20m
   * Max Distance (from player): 150m
   * Targets must be approximately 175m away from the related artillery piece (this range is unchanged).
Dev Note: These were previewed prior to the Fortification update, later mentioned in the Fortification patch notes, and are now ready for the Live environment. The new targeting system allows for more counter-play when painting a target as the player must remain exposed for the duration of the acquisition time and is no longer able to "lob" targeting darts from relative safety (or cloak and run to safety while the dart is still in the air).




Construction Changes


Glaive IPC
* Now stops firing after each volley.
* Added warning text to indicate an artillery strike for players in the area.
* Adjusted a socket so the terminal interaction prompt will no longer move as the cannon rotates.
The Flail
* Adjusted smoke indicator to red smoke to reduce confusion with squad smoke.
* Added warning text to indicate an artillery strike for players in the area.

                                                                                 Game servers will go down for our scheduled pc update tomorrow @ 6am pt / 3pm cest. for a 2 hr downtime window.

                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following update on Wednesday, June 7th, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.

Construction Overhaul


The construction system has received a major rework with the goals of making construction more accessible, more fun to fight at, and allow for more diverse base building.


Many new construction objects have been added, and some have been given a facelift (or reworked entirely,) and more cover and interior spaces are now available to fight around.
   



Learning Construction
* New, one-time construction-based tutorial missions have been added for players, and will reward players with the Elysium Spawn Tube, Infantry Tree Stand, Light Vehicle Terminal, and Equipment Terminal Module.
* Additional construction-based daily missions have been added to the pool for all players.
* VR Training now has Cortium spawns and facility silos, allowing for practice with construction objects.
UI Updates
* Removed the two-click process of placing a construction object, and you can now select either currency with a single click.
* Added new "Favorites" functionality, to mark your favorite construction objects in their own category.
* Buy, Unlock, and Equip button and terminology have all been adjusted to make more sense.
* Exiting the building terminal window will retain your last selection.
Placing Construction
* Controls for placing construction objects are now visible when a construction object is held.
* Construction placement spheres have been replaced with directional arrows showing whether they need to be above or below ground.
* Reduced the default rotation speed of construction objects.
* Sealed up the "holes" beneath certain construction objects, which would allow you to get inside the backface of the models.
Maintaining Construction
* Passive cortium drain has been removed. This change allows builders to set up bases far in advance of a fight that may or may not make its way down the lattice, instead of doing cortium runs for a fight that may never manifest.
* We've moved toward a more active form of cortium drain. The Flail, Glaive IPC, and Orbital Strikes will drain cortium when firing; Modules (which we talk about later) are equipped and placed into structures when the need arises; and vehicle/air pads still drain cortium as vehicles are used.
Interacting with Construction
* Cortium Silos within 500m now appear on your map and minimap.
* Spotlights attached to construction objects (like those at the Infantry Tower) now count as Darklights for the purposes of revealing cloaked targets.
* Spawn locations at construction bases now show the name of the player who owns the object.
* Additionally, there are new ways to interact with construction through Construction Outposts, Modules, and Attack Modules.
Construction Outposts
Construction Outposts (previously open-field vehicle capture bases) have been updated with a new Construction Outpost Silo. This silo is accessible to the faction who owns the region, and is accessible to any player on that faction. These outpost silos regenerate cortium over time, ensuring that construction assets are readily available to build with. When an outpost is captured by an opposing faction, construction objects within 100 meters are converted to the capturing faction's control. Players who previously owned these objects have their placement limits freed up so that they can build elsewhere.
   



Modules


Modules have all been converted into hand-held objects that can be slotted into new sockets on many of the construction objects. Modules come in a variety of types, allowing for base customization based on needs. Certain modules can only be equipped on specific construction objects, and a list of compatible modules is shown in the terminal screen.
* When you're at a construction base, empty module sockets appear on the HUD. While you're holding a module, the HUD will show compatible and incompatible module sockets, as well as which modules are socketed into which objects currently.
* Modules are socketed into empty slots, or can be swapped out with an existing module. Modules and their effects cannot be stacked, meaning that only one module of a given type can be slotted into a construction object at a time.
* Attackers can overload a module, much like a generator, by interacting with it. When the timer completes, the module detonates and deals some structural damage.
* Similarly, Cortium Bombs and Tunnel Worms can be equipped in the Tactical Slot by attackers. When placed into an empty socket, they'll either count down until major damage (Cortium Bomb), or prevent a structure from repairing (Tunnel Worm).
Standard Module
* Repair Module - Repairs the building over time, and increases max health by 5000.
* Projectile Shield Module - Provides the structure with shielded windows and doors, and increases max health by 2000. This shield is two-way.
* Skywall Shield Module - Provides the structure with a skywall shield, protecting from airborne attacks, no longer EMPs infantry. This shield is one-way.
* Firewall Module - Protects modules in the structure from being overloaded until the Firewall is brought down. Increases maximum health by 5000.
* Equipment Terminal Module - Provides the structure with an unhackable equipment terminal.
* Durability Module - Increases maximum health by 8000.
* Capacity Module - Increases the maximum cortium held by this object by 5000. Remains active until destroyed or replaced.
High Pressure Modules
* Heavy Repair Module - Repairs the building rapidly over time, and increases max health pool by 5000. Remains active for up to 1 minute.
* Fortress Shield Module - Provides a projectile bubble shield around the structure and surrounding area. This shield is two-way. Remains active for 1 minute.
* Heat Dispersion Module - Drastically reduces heat accumulation for the weapon while being operated by a player, increases maximum health pool by 2000. Remains active for 1 minute.
Tactical Slot Items
* Cortium Bomb - This item has been reworked into a bomb that players can slot into any module socket of an enemy building. Detonating after a short while, dealing incredible damage to the structure from the inside.
* Tunnel Worm - This module, when socketed into an enemy object, prevents it from regenerating health until it expires or is removed.
Removed Modules
* Turret AI Module - Artillery and Orbital Strike Uplinks no longer require this module.
* Alarm Module - Has been replaced with a Recon Array structure.
* Recon Module - Combined with the Alarm Module into the Recon Array structure.
New Construction Objects


Along with the many changes to construction itself, a variety of new buildings and cover pieces are now available.
* Command Center - The Command Center is a large structure that houses ground and air vehicle pads, and a secure spawn room and equipment terminal.
* Recon Array - This object alerts the owner to the presence of nearby enemies and attackers (similar to the Alarm Module), and passively checks for enemies nearby, similar to a Recon Device. The Recon Array can be activated manually to provide detailed motion sensing for a duration.
* Bulwark Walls (Thin/Wide variants) - These heavy walls are built high to help hide structures behind them.
* Module Dispenser - A module-only dispensary for placing near the areas you need it.
* Infantry Tunnel - A covered tunnel for safe infantry passage.
* Infantry Treestand - A compact, tall sniping perch for surveying the base below.
* Infantry Awning - A covered overhang to hold back fire from enemy aircraft.
* Secure Silo - Store additional cortium that you can lock for the use of you and your squad.
* Rebirthing Center - A shielded spawn point with a built-in equipment terminal.
* Vehicle Bridge - This bridge can span small gaps or smooth rough terrain, and is wide enough to allow a Colossus to cross.
* Light Post - A light post to illuminate, and detect infiltrators who pass beneath it.
* Blast Gate - A blast-wall styled checkpoint that allows infantry in and out, while blocking line of sight and protecting objects behind it.
* Mining Drill - Outfits can now craft Mining Drills as a War Asset, and place them as Construction items. These Mining Drills churn up Cortium nearby, allowing you to sustain a base... or use the crystals defensively.
   





Reworks and Removals


* Many of the one-way shields have been converted into two-way shields. Exceptions include the Skywall Shield, and shields that are specifically meant to allow spawning defenders to push out of their spawn room.
* Pain Spires and turret automation have been removed, and Skywall Shields no longer EMP shields. These mechanics aren't fun to play around for attackers, and one of our goals is meant to encourage back and forth gameplay throughout construction bases.
* The Orbital Strike Uplink has been converted into a larger building that can be played within and around, and Orbital Strikes on construction bases do significantly less damage than previously.
* The Bunker no longer has such a large footprint, and has a more accessible roof.
* "Anti-Vehicle" Melee Weapons no longer damage construction objects.
Misc. Construction Polish and More


* Elysium Spawn Tubes and other construction-based spawns now show the owner on the redeploy screen.
* Updated the visuals on the construction building FX.
* Added ambient audio to construction objects as they build.
* Many construction objects have received updated visuals.
* Updated and added FTEs and Codex entries related to construction.
* Triggering a Recon Array's "alarm module" functionality now has more visual messaging.
* We're still working on converting Flail, Glaive IPC, and Orbital Strike targeting darts into targeting lasers – this is almost complete, and is mainly down to polish.
* If you owned a previous construction module that was replaced in this update, you'll receive the new version of that module if an equivalent exists, or receive a cert refund in the event that it doesn't.

Server Performance Improvements
In this update, we've made significant performance optimizations to NPCs that can be "interacted with" by the player. These interactable NPCs include terminals, vehicles, generators, conduits, and certain mission objectives – basically any NPC that requires you to press a button to ask it to do something. Previously these NPCs would query interaction requirements on any character in range, even ones that aren't intending to use them. This change is especially important when it comes to CTF conduits, which were also checking for line of sight (another costly check) at sometimes long distances. We still have areas to investigate further when it comes to the creation of characters on a zone, but these NPC changes address one of the major areas of focus we outlined in an earlier update.


A Very Serious April
This year, April Fools is cancelled. We're still bringing back previous years holiday items, but we're not happy about it. You'll find last year's Jester's Bundle, The Schnoz (which gives an EXTRA 20% bonus experience while worn,) and the new Gone Fishing Bundle in the Depot through Apr. 09.


In accordance with this very serious holiday, we're also issuing DOUBLE EXPERIENCE for ALL PLAYERS through Apr. 03.


Gone Fishing Bundle - 1499 DBC
* Gone Fishing Profile Banner (All Factions)
* Tacklebox Drop Pod (All Factions)
* Fishing Hat (VS, NC, TR, NSO)
   

The new Fishing Hat and Tacklebox Drop Pod. Fishing system sold separately.


Faction-Specific Class Abilities
In this update, each faction receives one new class ability! In most cases, these are abilities that were available as prototypes during previous Campaigns, with balance adjustments and cleanup where needed.


Hermes Cloaking (VS Infiltrator only)
Provides a speed-enhancing cloak with added fall resistance to help you maneuver around the battlefield.
* Rank 1: Cloak lasts for 6.5 seconds, increases sprint speed by 20%, and recharges in 13 seconds.
* Rank 2: Cloak lasts for 7 seconds, increases sprint speed by 20%, and recharges in 12.5 seconds.
* Rank 3: Cloak lasts for 7.5 seconds, increases sprint speed by 20%, and recharges in 12 seconds.
* Rank 4: Cloak lasts for 8 seconds, increases sprint speed by 20%, and recharges in 11.5 seconds.

Demeter Veil (NC Heavy Assault only)
While active, the Demeter Veil reduces incoming damage to you and nearby allies for up to 6 seconds, but doesn't target allied MAX or Heavy Assaults.
* Rank 1: Reduces damage by 25% for up to 6 seconds. Protects allies within 5 meters and regenerates to full over 14 seconds.
* Rank 2: Reduces damage by 25% for up to 6 seconds. Protects allies within 5 meters and regenerates to full over 13 seconds.

* Rank 5: Reduces damage by 25% for up to 6 seconds. Protects allies within 6 meters and regenerates to full over 10 seconds.
Triage Pulse (TR Combat Medic only)
A pulse of healing nanites washes over nearby allies, causing them to regenerate health over time, and immediately restoring health for critically injured allies.
* Rank 1: Allies within 6 meters heal 60 health per second for 5 seconds. Allies below 100 health are healed for 100 health immediately. 25 second cooldown.
* Rank 2: Allies within 6 meters heal 60 health per second for 5 seconds. Allies below 100 health are healed for 125 health immediately. 25 second cooldown.
* Rank 3: Allies within 6 meters heal 60 health per second for 5 seconds. Allies below 150 health are healed for 125 health immediately. 25 second cooldown.
* Rank 4: Allies within 6 meters heal 60 health per second for 5 seconds. Allies below 150 health are healed for 150 health immediately. 25 second cooldown.
* Rank 5: Allies within 6 meters heal 60 health per second for 5 seconds. Allies below 200 health are healed for 150 health immediately. 25 second cooldown.
Repair Drone (NSO Engineer only)
NSO Engineers have the option to replace their turret with a loyal drone that will repair nearby mechanical targets. Enemies can destroy this drone.
* Rank 1: Repairs 40 health per second to mechanical targets within 10 meters. 45 second cooldown on deployment.
* Rank 2: Repairs 43 health per second to mechanical targets within 10 meters. 45 second cooldown on deployment.

Each faction has received new class abilities. There's probably a VS Infiltrator in this shot somewhere.


MAX Adjustments
The updates to MAX units below are, as a whole, meant to reduce the lethality and longevity of this equipment on the battlefield.


MAX units can no longer be revived
This is a major change that we'll be keeping a close eye on. Please continue to share thoughts and feedback after this change makes it into the wild.


Other MAX Adjustments
* Ordnance Armor now properly reduces damage from Infantry Lock-ons (type 68) by 20%. This was previously 0% for Infantry Lock-ons and 40% for Infantry Rocket Launchers (resist type 34.)
* MAX nanite cost from 450 to 350, now in parity with the Defector.
* Headshot multiplier for most MAX weapons reduced from 2x to 1.5x
* MAX units can no longer equip the Safeguard or Phylactery implants.
* Defector's Time Bomb no longer kills the user, and instead inflicts high self-damage and momentary slow upon detonation.
* Added new "Fallout Hardening" defensive slot that reduces incoming Orbital Strike damage by 11/14/17/22% and Burning damage by 50/60/70/75/80%.
NC-specific MAX Adjustments
Aegis Shield (NC MAX Ability)
* While the shield is active, energy now drains at a rate of 40 per second.
* Energy recharge rate from 150 per second to 80 per second.
Dev Note: These changes reduce the overall uptime of the Aegis Shield, and force more conscious management of the energy resource.


NCM1 Scattercannon
* From 5x pellets at 130@8m - 50@20m
* To 5x pellets at 100@8m - 50@20m
* Refire rate from 460ms to 500ms
AF-34 Mattock
* From 3x pellets at 112@15m - 92@50m
* To 3x pellets at 112@15m - 84@40m
AF-41 Hacksaw
* From 5x pellets at 75@8m - 50@15m
* To 5x pellets at 75@5m - 40@15m
AF-23 Grinder
* From 10x pellets at 50@8m - 35@20m
* To 8x pellets at 50@8m - 35@20m
Vehicle Adjustments
Nimitz Reactor (NC Vanguard Defensive Slot)
* A depleted shield no longer has a longer shield recharge time than the one caused by the normal damage delay, and is instead standardized at 6 seconds upon receiving any damage.
* Shield health regenerated per second from 100 at all ranks to 100/150/175/200 at ranks 1-4.
* Activating Forward Vanguard Shield, Fire Suppression, or Smoke Screen will restore 500 shield health immediately.
Dev Note: The changes here are meant to make Nimitz Reactor a more viable defensive slot option.


Perihelion (VS Lightning/Magrider Main Cannon)
* Charge time is no longer infinite, and can now be held for up to 5 seconds before automatically firing.
* This weapon still reaches a Stage 2 charge at 1 second, and a Stage 3 charge at 3 seconds.
JGX-12 (NC Vanguard Main Cannon)
* Direct damage from 650 to 600.
* Blast damage damage from 450 to 400.
JGX-11 (NC Lightning Main Cannon)
* Direct damage from 700 to 500.
* Indirect damage from 250 to 350.
* Reload speed from 3.75sec. to 4sec.
Dev Note: The intention behind these changes are to bring the overall damage output further in line with the Vanguard and Lightning's AP cannons, while retaining the alpha damage advantage these weapons exemplify.


ESF Infantry Lock-on Resistances
* ESF Infantry Lock-on resist (type 68) from -130 to -100. (Note: The Scythe was errantly at -150 resist, instead of the intended -130 prior to this update.)
* Dervish Infantry Lock-on resist (typ 68) from -125 to -60.
Dev Note: This pushes ESF into two lock-ons to burning, instead of two shots to kill; and the Dervish can now receive three hits before burning, instead of two.


M14 Banshee (TR Mosquito Nosegun)
* Extended Magazine size from 6/9/12/15 to 2/4/6/8 rounds.
* Maximum blast damage from 150 to 100.
M30 Mustang AH (NC Reaver Nosegun)
* Reduced Extended Magazine skill line ranks from 4 to 2. This skill line has been refunded due to the reduction in ranks and will need to be repurchased.
* Maximum blast damage from 100 to 60.
Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* Fixed an issue with the Ancient Psykinetic Blade looking "bunched up" under certain conditions.
* Fixed an issue preventing the Platoon Color picker from appearing when the dropdown is selected.
* Fixed a pixel-wide separation of tiling textures that would appear at certain mip levels.
* The first character on a new account can no longer skip the tutorial.
* Health and shield numerics has been defaulted on for new installations.
* Disruptor Ammunition's effect is no longer cloned on a weapon it is not equipped on, if you have it equipped on different weapon in the loadout.
* While on the redeploy screen, spawn option updates no longer close the remote vehicle spawn window.
                                
                                                                                           
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will be offline for the following update on Wednesday, March 8, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CET). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 3 hours.

Server Performance Progress
Work continues on resolving the server performance issues taking place during high-population hours, and even more so on Amerish. There are two main culprits we're investigating at the moment, the first is a character's "creation" in the zone, and the second has to do with NPCs running unnecessary checks in large areas.


For the first issue, we've noticed an unexpected amount of time being devoted to creating a character on a zone. In this case, "creating a character" refers to the act of a player warping to a zone for the first time (not the act of creating a character at the character create screen.) During our last telemetry capture, this was happening a little more than once per second as there tends to be a trickle of players into active combat zones during high-pop hours.


The second issue is that certain NPCs seem to be sweeping for nearby players over large areas, to determine whether certain interactions are valid. CTF NPCs in particular are among those we're looking into. Given that Amerish has the most CTF bases, and tends to be a popular continent in general, this could point to why performance seems to be worse there. This isn't confirmed just yet, but we're adding additional Telemetry instrumentation to this update to allow us to acquire more granular information in future captures.


TL;DR – Server performance continues to be a work-in-progress, and we have a few leads that we're actively looking into.

* ADVX Mako sniper rifle no longer plays incorrect audio while suppressed.
                                
                                                                                           
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will be offline for the following update on Wednesday, February 15, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CET). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 4 hours.

Extended Downtime
This update coincides with a company-wide downtime that begins at 6am PT, and is expected to last up to four hours. This downtime will affect login, commerce, and authentication services. Access to forums and websites will remain possible without login.


Known Issues
Reticle sizes are currently affected by window resolution, causing reticles to appear especially small on 4k monitors. We're currently working on a fix for this issue.


Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* Optimized firing audio for the SOAS-20, Artemis VX26, and AF-18 Stalker scout rifles. These weapons should no longer have audio stutter while firing.
* Fixed a reticle size issue with the NS-66 Punisher iron sights, CCLR optics (of all varieties,) and the Tigerstrike Decimator.
* Throwing dynamic NPCs (like ammunition packs) while underwater, now properly inherit the water drag.
* Having FSR enabled no longer causes Hossin's water plane to be shown at a reduced size.
* Fixed the preview visuals on the "Trash Eater" NSO Defector helmet.
* NSO Defectors are no longer missing a revive animation.
* Conducted a polish pass on various Settings UI menus.
                                
                                                                                           
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will be offline for the following update on Wednesday, February 8, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CET). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.

Nvidia DLSS
You'll now have access to Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology through the Graphics Settings menu. DLSS uses AI to enhance framerate performance on DLSS-enabled Nvidia cards.
Learn more here: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/




AMD FSR
We've also integrated AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution into the game, accessible in the Graphics Settings menu. AMD FSR can improve framerates using cutting edge upscaling technology, and can be used on any graphics card PlanetSide 2 supports.
Learn more here: https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/fidelityfx-super-resolution




Anti-Cheat
In this update, we beef up anti-cheat measures in a new system that was introduced in January. We've plugged some holes and adjusted the tuning parameters of the system to catch and kick instigators more quickly. It should be noted that this is not a replacement for reporting poor behavior, and doing so via the in-game commands or cheater@planetside2.com helps a great deal.




Server Performance
With this update, we'll be releasing new "profiling zones" to the server, which will expose more performance information. These changes come with some additional network baggage, so we've made it easy to replace the zones with the old ones, if the performance impact becomes too costly. We shouldn't need the profiling zones to remain active for too long to get the information we need, which is the next step in further diagnosis of the ongoing server performance issues.




API Updates
Team member MangoBean has been hard at work cleaning up the Census API and providing more access to third-party developers. Missing collections from new items, to new vehicles, continents and facilities, experience events related to CTF, new achievements, directive trees, and missing loadouts for NSO classes are some examples of information that's now surfaced. More experience events have also been added, allowing third party developers to track things like vehicle gunner kill assists and other shared vehicle experience.




Reflex/ACOG Rework
All reflex sights and ACOG (typically 3.4x to 4x optics) have been reworked to have consistent reticle sizing for any reticle of the same type. For example: All Red Dot reflex sights will have the same size dot as other Red Dot reflex sights, all Chevron reticle sights will have the same size as other Chevron reticle sights, etc.


Previously, all optics could vary in size based on the platform they were equipped upon. For example, one LMG's reticles could be larger than another LMG's reticles, and the most dramatic differences could often be seen between sidearms and primary weapons. That should no longer be the case.


Additionally, you now have the ability to change the color of reflex and ACOG reticles from the Settings menu, and you can even hide the reticle entirely!


   

Shown: An example of the reticle color tinting on a (traditionally blue) NC reticle.




Gender Change Token
Auraxians around the world can now change their character's gender by unlocking a token in the Depot.
Voice packs you own will automatically allow access to an "equivalent" voice pack on the gender you're swapping to.


Note: Some voice packs don't have one-for-one conversions across gender, and have instead been packaged alongside similar voice packs. Example: The "Tough" Female has been packaged with the "Gruff" Male voice. All voice packs have been repackaged in this way, and in many cases renamed.


Gender Change tokens will be available for 1 Cert through February and March, and increase to 1000 Certs beyond that.




Remote Vehicle Spawn
We've re-enabled the ability to deploy vehicles from the map remotely at any base that is not contested.


Dev Note: The spawn system changes toward the end of last year mostly achieved our design goals with the pacing of deployment, and we feel comfortable enough to return this feature to the game in the form stated above.




Character Slot Increase
Increased the total number of character slots for Members by one, and increased the total number of purchasable slots by 2. This brings the total number of available character slots per account to 16.




NSO Faction Colors
All NSO-specific weapons and attachments now take on the accent colors of the faction they're associated with.


   

Example of the updated NSO weapon colors for a character aligned to the Terran Republic.




No-Deploy Zones
* Sunderer to Sunderer no-deploy exclusion radius from 65m to 50m.
* Tech Plants on Amerish and Hossin now use Indar's no-deploy zone placement, as this change was well-received during the Indar test run.
* Warpgates now show no-deploy areas.
* Colossus can no longer deploy in a no-deploy zone.
Capture Mechanics
* Adjacent regions now only count as "contested" when a timer is active in that region, or in the case of a Conduit Outpost, when a flag has been captured.
* Capture the Conduit Repos and Conduits can no longer be interacted with if you have no secure lattice link, and additional messaging now conveys as much to the player.
Dev Note: This solves an issue where a single player could control a single capture point in a four-point base, and prevent the capture of the next base in the lattice until someone redeploys to deal with them, and has the benefit of making it clear on the map when a base is actively contested or not.




Continent Benefits
Continent benefits have been removed for the time being. This includes Indar and Esamir's benefits, which have been non-operational for many years.


Dev Note: These benefits don't currently act as strong motivation to capture a continent, which defeats their intended purpose. We're disabling these benefits to tie up some loose threads in the current experience, but aren't opposed to bringing back map-persistent benefits in some form if there are good suggestions out there.




Mission System
The Overview screen has been removed, in line with the changes we've made to auto-claiming missions.
Additionally, the following new Missions have been added to the daily pool:
* Concealed Chaos (Black Market) - Earn 500 experience while cloaked.
* Clandestine Operative (Black Market) - Earn experience by gathering intel or sabotaging enemy facilities.
* Conduit Control (Nanite Systems) - Capture a Conduit Facility.
Valentine's Day Event (Feb. 08 - Feb. 14)
The Depot has received a bundle containing a lovely new NSX Amaterasu variant, as well as the return of Valentine's Day offerings from previous years.


Sweet Nothings Bundle - 1499 DBC
* Queen of Hearts (NSX Amaterasu variant)
* Love Letter Decal (Usable as Outfit Decal)
* Sugar Tile Camo (VS/NC/TR/NSO)
   

Love stings, when it stabs all the bad things.


New Directive - A new directive makes an appearance for the duration of the event, rewarding 2000 ISO-4 and the "Huggable" title upon completion.


New Missions - Matchmaker missions have made their way back to Auraxis. You can complete up to two of these missions per day, and earn extra progress through the event directive.


   







Balance Adjustments
Impulse Grenade (Light Assault Grenades)
* Nanite cost from 50 to 25.
D7 Hummingbird (NSO Defector)
* Improved lock-on acceleration and projectile turn rate.
* Increased lifespan from 4sec. to 6sec.
Dev Note: The changes here make the Hummingbird more capable of chasing down aircraft who've strayed too close.


AR-ARX Maxwell (NSO Directive Assault Rifle)
* Maximum damage range from 10m to 15m.
* Minimum damage from 100 to 112.
* Magazine size from 26 to 30.
* Reserve Ammo from 208 to 210.
Dev Note: The damage bump helps alleviate the tradeoff penalty incurred by the higher rate of fire, and the Maxwell has received the AR-100's recent magazine size buff as well.


Disruptor Ammunition
* This ammunition type has been standardized across most weapons.
* Each weapon has 20% of its direct damage converted into the weapon's disruption effect.
* A struck target's maximum shield and ability energy is reduced by 0.4% for every point of damage converted (this effect takes place after the initial bullet damage is dealt.)
* In each case (aside from the Thumper, which remains unchanged,) this ammunition type has received a buff. Previously, most weapons provided a flat 10% drain of maximum shield and energy.
* Strings related to this ammunition type now also better describe the actual effect, and references to unused legacy benefits have been removed.
* Lastly, this ammunition type was providing only the passive drawbacks (and no benefits) for the following weapons: Tempest, NC9 A-Tross, GD Guardian, AF-6 Shadow. Congratulations to anyone who has been playing on hard mode since the Arsenal Update.
Percent drains per shot for each weapon are listed below:
* NC9 A-Tross drains 16% per shot.
* MGR-A1 Vanquisher drains 16% per shot.
* AF-6 Shadow drains 27% per shot.
* The Executive drains 18% per shot.
* Tempest drains 13% per shot.
* GD Guardian drains 20% per shot.
New Depot Items
* Fuzzbuket's NSO Defector helmet, "Trash Eater" is now available in the Depot.
* Binaryc0der's NSO "Response" armors are now available for Light Assault, Heavy Assault, Medic, and Engineer. The existing Infiltrator Response armor has received some visual updates as well.
   

Fuzzbuket's "Trash Eater" helmet on the NSO Defector.


Big Bug Fixes
* Fixed an issue where camouflage could appear incorrect on remote clients. The days of seeing a Prowler caked in bright yellow, instead of glorious metallic pink, are gone.
* Added automatic removal of "stale squads" that last longer than a few days. If you've seen a "squad leader" that doesn't actually exist (sometimes appearing as a dorito at some obscure place in the world with no body attached to it,) that's what we're referring to. We've seen instances of these stale squads staying for longer than 20 days, in some cases, and would previously be cleared organically when a server was restarted.
* Sunderer and Galaxy now display their ammo and repair icons on the minimap once again. In addition, Deliverer ANTs now show an ammo icon, Lodestar Galaxies now show their deployed state, Lockon Jammer Galaxies show a unique icon, and Corsair resupply and proximity healing are now also shown as map icons.
Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* Removed the "Member Early Access" category from the Depot (it hasn't been updated since 2014ish) and the items therein have been made purchasable by all players.
* Chat now displays a channel suggestion prompt in the text field, instead of an empty box.
* Toggling the ignore incoming tells function now requires you to relog to take effect.
* Clicking on an open character slot now begins the character creation phase, instead of waiting for you to press the Create Character button.
* Updated text size and verbiage of the All Access Member popup.
* Speculative fix for edge cases where you could be kicked from a squad/platoon, but still see their waypoints and chat communication.
* Fixed an animation issue where player models would "pop" when a player enters their idle animation from a locomotion state.
* Fixed an issue where Infravision would highlight yourself after exiting a vehicle.
* Infravision implant's description now conveys that you cannot see cloaked targets.
* Jackrabbit's reflex sight reticle no longer becomes invisible when the user cloaks.
* Fixed an animation issue caused by crouching while reloading the NS-61 Emissary and variants.
* Fixed rechamber animations for the ADVX//Mako, Ghost, Parallax, V10, and XM98.
* The Year of the Tiger decal no longer tints Auraxium Armor color red when worn.
* All Heavy Assault shields and Combat Medic abilities have been enabled for underwater use.
* The "roots" of underwater seaweed should no longer sway with the rest of the foliage.
* Anti-Aliasing is now available to players on Low graphics quality settings.
* Added frame housing to the Endeavor reflex optics.
* Updated messaging in the voice pack dropdown for unowned voice packs.
* Receiving a headshot as an NSO character now uses the same audio as receiving a headshot on a non-NSO character, for consistency.
* Fixed an issue with the Dive! horn not playing correct audio in first person while equipped on a ground vehicle on land.
Looking Forward
Work on the construction revamp is well underway as we develop the tech needed for updates to modules, clean up problems with existing assets, and develop new placeable objects, like the Command Center below. We've also taken feedback on the design into consideration and amended some points of execution, like the ANT's harvesting capabilities. Instead of chunking bits of cortium that then need to be scooped up, we'll stick with the existing mining lasers, and make some adjustments to the cortium veins to make them more interactive. The current design is to add spawning weakpoints that can accelerate harvesting or give additional resources when targeted. Concerns about the need to constantly replace modules have been heard as well, and we can easily increase how long basic modules stick around before needing to be replaced. It's still early days with the development of this update, and we'll share more as we get further along.
-Wrel, Lead Designer


   

Shown: The WORK IN PROGRESS Command Center construction placeable next to an Infantry Tower and ANT for scale. The Command Center has a multi-story combat interior, and is meant to be the capstone of a well-developed base.                                 
                                                                                           
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will be offline for the following update on Wednesday, January 18, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CET). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.

* NS-61 "Jackrabbit" Emissary (Common Pool Sidearm)
* Year of the Rabbit Banner

* Repository now has a visible timer associated with it on the map and HUD.


Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions

* Fixed an animation issue causing some bolt-action rifles to skip rechamber animations on remote clients while walking. This issue affected the AF-8 Railjack, EM4 Longshot, LA80, NC14 Bolt Driver, SAS-R, M77-B, RAMS .50M, SR-7, and TSAR-42.
* Fixed an animation issue where you could enter a walking animation while sprinting, after falling from a height.

* NSO speech packs no longer appear in the dropdown for non-NSO factions.
* Fixed typos in the Battlefield Supremacy mission.
* The Flak Attack mission is no longer capable of earning progress in VR Training.
* Disabled all "unused" missions. This change is intended to fix an issue with certain legacy missions persisting in a mission list for some players.
        All PC servers will come down for the following update on Wednesday, January 11, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CET). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.
--


Mission System
* As of this update, completed missions will automatically provide rewards when completed.
* Fallback mission rewards have been added for players capped on the reward currency a mission would provide.
* Removed the mission accepted messages from the Message Courier and Bounty Hunter missions.
* Added an additional "soldiering" (infantry-focused) mission to the daily pool, increasing the total daily mission count to 7 for all players.
Upcoming Missions Changes
* Starting in February, changes to the Overview screen will prevent stockpiled missions from being redeemable. Please claim any stockpiled missions you have before February to ensure you receive the rewards.
* Additionally, a few of the Subterfuge Directive missions will be making their way into the Black Market and Nanite Systems mission pools to diversify mission types further.
Capture the Conduit (CTF)
* You can now see the flag counts on contested CTF bases from any zoom level, and we've drawn more attention to the map icons.
* Added Codex entries for Conduit Repositories and Conduit Podiums.
* Reverted Elli Tower on Esamir back to a Control-style base.
* Picking up a Conduit while Infravision is equipped no longer blinds the user.
Upcoming CTF changes, but not in for this update:
* A countdown timer will be added to the Repo when hacked, similar to a generator.
* Repo HUD indicators will blink while being hacked (currently only the map icon does.)
Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* Conquest (Prime Time) alert conditions now trigger at 750 on all non-Oshur continents (was previously 800,) and 600 on Oshur.

* Unstable Meltdowns once again use their restricted region layouts when activated.
* Fixed an issue that could cause a black, circular shadow to appear in the center of the screen.
* Did a consistency pass on the settings menu in the Character Create screen.
* Fixed an issue causing some ANT mining lasers to show as having critical ammo counts on the vehicle right-side HUD.

* Adjusted FoV of VX29 Polaris to put it in line with other VS LMGs.
* Fixed an issue with the NS-30 "Gungnir" Vandal's bolt sliding during the short reload animation.
Looking Forward
Hey there. While we're still lining up the calendar for the entirety of 2023, we're currently working to stabilize some aspects of the game here in January. That includes better in-game anti-cheat measures, diagnosing problems with server performance (particularly on Emerald,) and improvements to Capture the Conduit. This year we'll be making a major effort to return to systems that have untapped potential, and tighten the game up as much as we can. We'll be sharing more of the plan for this year later in the month.
-Wrel, Lead Designer                                         
                                                                                           
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following update on Wednesday, December 14, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CET). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.
--


Capture the Flag
* Hacking a Repo now initiates and overload that lasts for 30 seconds before it converts the Repo to your faction.
* This 30-second countdown can be interrupted by the opposing faction.
Dev Note: The changes here will prevent easy re-secures, and was a major missing piece in the overall flow of the CTF capture type. Please share your feedback on the updated CTF mechanics after the update goes Live.




Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* Perihelion's charged fire now shows projectiles correctly on remote clients.
* Firing a weapon and switching to a repair/healing tool no longer causes a player to be stuck in an infinite firing loop on remote clients.
* Fixed an issue where entering/re-entering a vehicle as a MAX suit could hide your ability HUD display.
* NS-R3 Swarm variants no longer mention "Flak Detonation" in their descriptions.
* Various model and animation cleanup on the NS-11C Frostbite.
* Amerish Sky adjustments.
* Outfit War statues on Sanctuary now display outfit information once again.
* Doubled the amount of Snowman that can be spawned on a continent at once.
* Snowmen no longer spawn on locked continents.
* Chimera's Avalanche Tire Trails now appear on the middle set of tires.
* Removed campaign currencies from the handful of store items that still used them.
* Fixed an issue preventing NSO from using faction-based jump pads at the following bases:
   * Howling Pass (Indar)
   * Saurva Bio Lab (Indar)
   * Dahaka Amp Station (Indar)
   * Zurvan Amp Station (Indar)
   * Peris Amp Station (Indar)
   * Freyr Amp Station (Esamir)
   * Jord Amp Station (Esamir)
   * Naum Amp Station (Hossin)
   * Hurakan Amp Station (Hossin)
   * Ixtab Amp Station (Hossin)
   * Broken Vale Garrison (Hossin)
                                
                                                                                           
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following update on Wednesday, December 7, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.

* Instead, members will receive increased mission rewards.
   





Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* Reinstated the temporary population reductions on each continent. Dev Note: This change was mistakenly reset after rolling zone restarts Wednesday last week, resulting in poor server performance due to high populations in conjunction with the spawn system changes.
* Fixed an issue where skies would take too long to transition from one sky file to the next. This also fixes the problem with Oshur's underwater visuals persisting for a couple of seconds after resurfacing.
* Warpgate spawns on locked continents no longer appear in the redeploy dropdown.
* You no longer see underwater "god rays" while in the lower level of Naum Amp Station on Hossin.
* NS-30 "Gungnir" Vandal's magazine no longer disappears momentarily during a reload.
* Fixed an issue with DBC prices sometimes overlapping long Depot bundle lists.
* Havoc Missiles are now referred to by their correct name in the ESF directives.
* Polished various Conduit carry animations.
                                
                                                                                           
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following update on Wednesday, November 30, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.

Liberator
* Infantry Lock-on Resist (type 68) from -75 to -50.
Valkyrie
* Infantry Lock-on Resist (type 68) from -100 to -45.

* Zealot Overdrive's Burster flak damage from 31 to 38.
* Cone of Fire from 2 to 3.

                                                                                 All PC servers will be offline for the following update on Thursday, November 17, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CET). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 3 hours.

Capture the Conduit
With the 10-year anniversary, we've added a whole new way to wage war. You'll see various bases throughout Auraxis outfitted with a new CTF-style mechanic we call Capture the Conduit.


Attacking a Conduit Outpost goes like so.
1. Hack a Repo.
2. Steal a Conduit.
3. Deposit the Conduit into the Repo.
4. Repeat.
Defending a Conduit Outpost goes similarly.
* Re-secure hacked Repos.
* Return stolen Conduits.
* Repeat.
A more detailed breakdown is found below.
Each Conduit Outpost has at least one Podium and one Repository (or "Repo",) but some bases have more.


Podiums hold Conduits that attackers must steal from the defenders. Conduits can only be off a podium for a limited amount of time, and any captured Conduits respawn after a short delay.


Each outpost has a certain number of captures, referred to as "strikes," against a base before it's conquered by attackers. The faction that captures the last Conduit will conquer the base.
   



Conduits
Grabbing a Conduit will give you a short burst of speed and restore your shields, but you can't fire weapons, and some abilities have reduced effectiveness while a Conduit is held.


Dropping a Conduit puts your suit's hazard protection on cooldown, preventing you from picking it back up for a time, but an ally (or enemy) can pick it up immediately.


If a defending player interacts with a dropped Conduit, it is immediately re-secured, and the Podium it came from will generate a new Conduit in its place.
   



Repositories
To attack a base, you'll need to hack one of these Repos to establish your presence.


A Repo is where attackers can cash in the Conduits they've stolen.


Capturing a Conduit by depositing it into a Repo will earn a strike toward the base.


If defenders are able to re-secure all Repos at a base, the base itself will be immediately re-secured, and the assault will need to begin anew.
   

Dev Note: Currently, Repos only take a few seconds to hack, but this will be converted to an overload-style mechanic in the near future.


Below is the list of bases converted to Conduit Outposts.
Amerish
* The Bastion
* Shrouded Skyway
* Splitpeak Pass
* Onatha Southwest Gate
* Wokuk Watchtower
* Crux Headquarters
* West Pass Watchtower
Indar

Map and Environment
The following bases and lattice links have received updates.
Amerish
Ikanam Biolab
* Three capture points are now located within the facility, and an additional fourth capture point has been added in the construction area atop the base.
* Greenery has been added atop the construction area to provide cover... and color.
* Vehicle terminal area now has more room for vehicle deployments.
The Bastion
* Added more cover along tower walkways.

Andvari South Bank
* Has received more cover along the bridge area.
Oshur
* Bastions are now available on Oshur.
* Has received a new mid-tier stabilized state, like other continents.


Bastion Fleet Carrier
The Bastion Fleet Carrier has received a role adjustment that places its power in the realm of map control. This massive vehicle can now hasten attacks on enemy bases, stall attacks on allied bases, and become a spawn point for more than just your Outfit.


New Commands
Three new commands have been added to the Bastion's repertoire - Lockdown, Assault, and Anchor.
* Issuing the Lockdown command over an allied facility area that is being captured will cause the Fleet Carrier to fly over and pause the capture timer.
* Issuing the Assault command over an enemy facility area will accelerate the capture timer of a facility that's currently being captured, as if it had one additional capture point already controlled in your favor.
* Issuing the Anchor command will turn the Bastion into a spawn point for the entire faction.
Each of these commands last until the Fleet Carrier issues a new command or is destroyed.


Mauler Cannons
* Mauler Cannons and the Attack command have been removed.
Bastion's Ship to Ship Cannons
* CoF Recovery Rate from 0.67 to 8
* Ironsights in/out time from 3sec. to 0.5sec.
Dev Note: The above adjustments make these weapons a bit less of a headache to use.

Graphics Improvements
We've developed a number of new graphical enhancements and updates in anticipation for the Anniversary release.


Texture Updates
We've polished many of the texture sheets in our game by bringing them more in line with current physically based rendering (PBR) standards. Overall, the changes pull back some of the excessive grunge on structures and vehicles, bumps up the reflectivity, and makes the faction colors on painted metal feel a bit more vibrant.
   

   



Water Reflections
Oshur's ocean now looks more... ocean-y, with the addition to water-based reflections. You can adjust the quality settings of these water reflections in the Graphics menu.
   



Screen Space Reflections
Many of the glossy surfaces in the game will now reflect what you see on your screen when the new "Screen Space Reflections" are activated. We refer to this in the Graphics menu as "Object Reflections", the higher the quality, the more detail they'll reflect.
   



Sky Improvements
We've made updates to the skies across Auraxis, generally adding more color to the environment and cleaning up issues like blocky clouds.
   



New Explosions
Many of the on-impact explosions have received visual revamps, as well as performance optimizations.


Anti-Aliasing Options
You now have new anti-aliasing options to choose from, allowing you to smooth out those jagged edges. We've added options for FXAA, TAA, and FXAA+TAA.
Dev Note: The TAA options need a bit more refinement, which will land in a later update.




Advanced Specialization Program 03 is now Unlocked
* For the hardcore battle rank enthusiasts, we've unlocked A.S.P. 03 for you to pursue.
* A.S.P. is unlocked by achieving Battle Rank 100, and visiting the My Character screen, and provides access to hybrid class unlocks and other advanced loadout customization options.
* Certing into A.S.P. costs 10,000 Certs, and is FREE if you're a Member.

Many of the balance adjustments below have been made based on community feedback.


Shotguns
Pandora VX25, AF-57 Piston, AS16 NightHawk, SG-A25 (Empire Automatic Shotguns )
* Maximum damage from 125 to 112.
* Magazine size from 8 to 6.
* Ammo capacity from 56 to 54.
* Fixed a typo on the Piston's Extended Magazine purchase data that incorrectly mentions 4 rounds.
NC05 Jackhammer (NC Heavy Weapon)
* Burst fire pellet spread from 2.5 to 3.5
* Burst fire pellet count from 5 to 4.
Phobos VX86, GD-66 Claw, TRS-12 Uppercut (Empire Pump Shotguns)
* Maximum damage from 125 to 100.
* Minimum damage from 50 to 63.
Dev Note: This is a heavy swing. These weapons will very likely need to get tuned back into a more usable position once more data comes in.


Deimos VA29, LA39 Bruiser, TAS-16 Blackjack, HSG-400 (Empire Heavy Pump Shotguns)
* Maximum damage from 125 to 100.
* Minimum damage from 50 to 63.
* Maximum damage range from 8m to 5m.
Dev Note: Similar to the above, this heavily reduces these weapons' effectiveness, and will likely need to get tuned upward after this update to make them more competitive with the semi-autos.


Non-shotgun Weapon Adjustments
Vanu Sovereignty
Prominence VE4 (Carbine)
* Min damage from 112 to 125.
VX29 Polaris (LMG)
* Min damage from 112 to 125.
* Reload speed from 4.925 long / 3.925 short to 4.225 long / 3.225 short.
New Conglomerate
EM1 (LMG)
* Min damage from 112 to 125.
NC6 Gauss SAW (LMG)
* Min damage from 167 to 143.
NC6S Gauss SAW S (LMG)
* Min damage from 167 to 143.
NC6A GODSAW (LMG)
* Min damage from 167 to 143.
Terran Republic
T5 AMC (Carbine)
* Min damage from 112 to 125.
T16 Rhino (LMG)
* Min damage from 112 to 125.
Nanite Systems Operatives
CB-ARX Newton (Carbine)
* Reduced projectile size to be in line with most other weapons.
CB-200 (Carbine)
* Rate of fire from 550 rounds per minute to 577 rounds per minute.
AR-100 (Assault Rifle)
* Magazine size from 28 to 30.
* Ammunition capacity from 196 to 210.
AR-101 (Assault Rifle)
* Magazine size from 28 to 30.
* Ammunition capacity from 196 to 210.
XMG-200 (LMG)
* Min damage from 125 to 143.
Misc. Infantry Adjustments
Aegis Shield (NC MAX ability)
* Health at maximum rank from 3000 to 2250.
* Energy regeneration rate no longer increases per rank.
Infantry Rocket Launchers
Lock-on infantry launchers, and a few others have received a noteworthy revision.
* Added new "Infantry Lock-on" resist type (68)
* Abilities that modify damage from "Infantry Launchers" also modify this damage resistance (eg. Flak Armor, Flanker Armor)
Dev Note: The addition of this resist type lets us get away from using the "flak" functionality for lock-on launchers in order to deliver their AoE damage separately from the direct damage the weapons deal to ground vehicles. Now, a direct hit delivers the damage, and the AoE triggers explosive splash as you'd expect from a rocket launcher. The resist type has been configured to deal the same damage to ground vehicles as infantry launchers currently do, and more damage to aircraft than it was doing on the previous flak resistance.


Nemesis VSH9, Hawk GD-68, ASP-30 Grounder, LAV-LA (Empire Anti-Air Lockons)
* Direct damage resist type from 34 (Infantry Rocket Launcher) to 68 (Infantry Lock-on)
* Blast damage resist type from 12 (Flak) to 6 (Common Explosive)
* Blast damage from 400@5m-50@8m to 300@0.5m-50@3m
* This weapon no longer requires a flak detonation to trigger its AoE damage.
NS Annihilator (Common Pool Lock-on)
* Direct damage resist type from 34 (Infantry Rocket Launcher) to 68 (Infantry Lock-on)
* Blast damage resist type from 12 (Flak) to 6 (Common Explosive)
* Direct damage from 650 to 675.
* Blast damage from 325@5m-1@8m to 350@1m-50@3m
* This weapon no longer requires a flak detonation to trigger its AoE damage.

Thank You
PlanetSide 2 was originally released on November 20, 2012... since then we've spent the last decade fighting over this massive, chaotic sandbox filled with explosions and gunfire. My first, most vivid memory of the early days was just after character creation – being briefed by the Overseer in that VO sequence we used to have, then dropping into a fight via Drop Pod. I was fully immersed as the metal screeched toward the ground below, the excitement and anticipation building.


Landing in an open field on Esamir (totally unhelpful, in retrospect,) I was close enough to an Amp Station to know I should head there, and far enough away to get absolutely destroyed by anyone noticing me scrambling across the coverless tundra. I was able to take out two targets (also, strangely in this open field) before getting gunned down myself. It was at that moment that I was hooked. There was something empowering about the challenge the game offered. Constantly whispering "I dare you to try," and forging memorable experiences from circumstance and possibility.


I imagine that many of you have similar memories, and that in some strange way, it's the cumulation of all those moments that have kept this game going strong ten years down the line. Thank you all for the challenge, on the battlefield, and even in the design space; the community, without which we would never have made it this long; and the memories, which I'm sure we'll make more of for years to follow.

Halloween Event (Oct. 05 - 31)
A bitter moon hangs high overhead, casting an ominous light over the battlefields of Auraxis. The bitter battle between soldier and SpacePumpkin has begun once again!
This year's Nanite of the Living Dead carries with it a new directive, a new mission, a new alert event, and striking new cosmetics.


Space Pumpkins Return!
Don't let their innocent orange guise fool you, these sinister pumpkins will descend upon you when you least expect it. Eradicate these gords and earn bonus experience and directive progress!
   

An orange device of corruption and sorrow.


Halloween Directive
Trick or treat! Get started with this special event directive by visiting your favorite vendors while on Sanctuary. Then head planetside to take on some haunting heroics as you work toward unlocking a "Wicked" new title and camo.
   



Halloween Sanctuary
Sanctuary has received some ghoulish garland this time of year, complete with festive vendors and citizens, decorations, and music to bewitch your spirit.
   



Haunted Bastion Event
An unaligned Bastion Fleet Carrier has been reported marauding the battlefields. Rumor has it that this Lost Fleet Carrier was a part of the original expedition through the wormhole to Auraxis. Unfortunately, it is either incapable or unwilling to respond to our hails. Despite multiple successes destroying this vessel, it seems to reappear again elsewhere in the world, continuing its wanton destruction.


What we do know is that the Fleet Carrier is capable of destabilizing the lattice hardlines while it is on the field, rendering regions of the map incapable of being contested or captured until it is destroyed. We have also discovered that the more SpacePumpkins we dispose of, the more likely this vessel is to appear and wreak havoc on the front lines.
   





New to the depot
In addition to returning Halloween tire trails, camos, profile banners, weapons, armor, and helmets, some new offerings are hitting the table!


Alchemist Bundle - 3999 DBC
Did someone call for the doctor? The Alchemist Bundle comes with a new title, banner frame, profile banner, cosmetic helmets for each faction, and the best Punisher SMG a plague doctor could ask for.
* Title: Doctor
* Midnight Banner Frame
* Alchemical Profile Banner
* Plague Doctor Cowl (NSO/VS/NC/TR)
* NS-66 "Alchemist" Punisher
   

Shown: VS Plague Doctor Cowl and NS-66 "Alchemist" Punisher.




Lightbringer Bundle - 3999 DBC
Stand against the darkness with the Lightbringer Bundle. A new title, banner frame, profile banner, NS-R3 Swarm rocket launcher variant, and a cosmetic variant of the default sniper rifle for each faction.
* Title: Guardian
* Knight Errant Banner Frame
* Majesty Banner
* NS-R3 "Dawnstinger" Swarm
* M77-B "Dawnbreaker" (TR Sniper Rifle)
* NC14 "Dawnbreaker" (NC Sniper Rifle)
* XM98 "Dawnbreaker" (VS Sniper Rifle)
* SR-100 "Dawnbreaker" (NSO Sniper Rifle)
   

Shown: M77-B "Dawnbreaker" sniper rifle.




PMC Armor and Helmets
The new PMC armor and helmets by player studio creator Doku are now available for all New Conglomerate characters.
   

Shown: PMC Heavy Assault Armor and PMC Visor Helmet.


New Tank Cannons
The arms race intensifies as factions deliver new Empire-specific Main Battle Tank (and for the first time ever,) Lightning main cannons.


New Conglomerate
* The JGX12 (Vanguard) and JGX11 (Lightning) turrets function similar to artillery, with better turret elevation, made for lobbing anti-armor explosives. With a heavy projectile arc, the high skill ceiling is repaid with the best single-shot anti-vehicle damage in the arsenal.
   





Vanu Sovereignty
* The Perihelion VXC (Magrider) and Perihelion L-VXC (Lightning), fires an anti-armor crescent wave with a flat trajectory. This anti-vehicle weapon can be charged up to fire up to three crescents in a single burst.
   





Terran Republic
* The P4-120 Kingsnake (Prowler) and L2-100 Kingsnake (Lightning) fire a 4-shell and 2-shell burst respectively, peppering an area with high-impact anti-vehicle shells. At close to mid-range, the Kingsnake rewards users with some of the highest damage output in the game.
   





Nanite Systems Operatives
* The Larion PPC (Chimera) and the Larion LPPC (Lightning) are particle projection cannons that fire a lance of light, piercing through infantry and vehicles alike. This weapon has no projectile drop, or area of effect damage, and travels quickly to snipe targets at a distance.
   





Infantry Updates
Tank Mine
* Minimum damage from 10 to 100.
Dev Note: Increases the damage consistency over the falloff range.


Anti-Vehicle Grenades
* Resistance type from 37 (Infantry Launcher) to 11 (Heavy Explosives)
* Nanite cost from 50 to 75.
Dev Note: This converts Anti-Vehicle Grenades into a competitive C4 alternative with more reach and less alpha damage.


SPRK-33's Stomper
* Direct damage from 200 to 225.
* Blast maximum damage from 350 to 375.
* Blast minimum damage from 1 to 50.
Dev Note: These changes make SPRK-33's Stomper a little more umph and usability for what is otherwise a fairly lackluster weapon.




UI and Accessibility
* You now have the ability to increase player/vehicle overhead indicator sizes, and is found in the HUD indicator settings.
   

Choose from small or large vehicle and player indicators in the HUD Indicators settings.




Containment Sites
* The energy room capture point has been moved upstairs, and turning the generator on will no longer capture the point for defenders.
* Removed the Sunderer no-deploys at these locations, allowing vehicles to deploy in the central hub.
* Fixed some errant, invisible collision at Containment Sites.
Dev Note: The intention here is to keep the fight (slightly) more centralized to the middle floor, and make these facilities more easily capturable without overwhelming force.
   





Oshur and Water-based Gameplay
* Oshur now uses an unstable lattice while continent population is low.
* Seaposts with underwater capture points have received new underwater spawn rooms to help prevent spawnroom camping from below the platform.
* Gate Shield Diffuser now allows wheeled vehicles to sink. This change impacts the Sunderer the most, allowing it to deploy on the ocean floor, and provide another spawnpoint for attackers.
* Corsair has received a new "Submerge" ability which momentarily allows it to sink beneath the water's surface. This is intended to give the Corsair more options to avoid damage when cover options are limited.
* Deployed vehicles are no longer affected by buoyancy.
   

The new underwater spawn room at Seapost G8 - Pipeline, on Oshur.




Construction Adjustments
* Elysium Spawn Tube is now immune to small arms damage.
* Cortium Bombs are no longer usable by Infiltrators.
* Pain Spire has new, more readily discernable visual FX.
* Pain Spire's damage resistance from 23 (Air to Ground Warhead) to 64 (Burning) to be in line with other burning effects.
   

New visual FX for Pain Spires.




Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* !! Fixed a long-standing issue where Cortium/NPC spawns (like Pumpkins!) could appear underground or inside objects.
* Made code efficiency improvements to how Zone Flags are handled.
* As an experiment: No-deploy zones at Tech Plants on Indar have been pushed toward the spawn rooms.
* Sticky Grenades and C4 no longer stick to spawn room shields.
* Outfits without a MOTD set no longer have a blank message appear upon login.
* Fixed an issue that could prevent you from accessing Outfit Chat while on Nexus.
* Ground vehicle ammunition dispensers now resupply ammunition to Corsair within range.
* Observer cameras no longer receive Out of Bounds messaging.
* Countershade implant has been added to implant packs and crafting.
* The following weapons no longer use the incorrect compensator model: NC1 Gauss Rifle, Gauss Rifle Burst, Gauss Rifle S
* Fixed a bug preventing the T1A Unity from hipfiring underwater.
* Adjusted Sunderer visuals so that the vehicle is now slightly less "dirty."
* Sanctuary gravity lifts now push you toward the elevator exit.
* Fixed a missing backface on an Oshur rock type.
* Added a missing aircraft ammo resupply point at Anlabban Trident on Oshur.
Looking Forward
Hey there. As we mentioned in the September article, we're currently focused on slower refining our releases and are slowing down the content cadence as a result. Over the past month, we've released iterative updates to the Public Test Server (a total of 4 throughout September) to ensure that everyone has had a chance to provide feedback on changes well before they make their way Live. Thank You to the folks who've helped temper those updates. So far as the Roadmap for the remainder of the year is concerned, we're definitely going to be setting aside a lot of what we've originally planned to accomplish. We simply don't want to jam large systems into the game without enough time to test them properly, and the value of those systems has certainly come into question the nearer we get to them as well. While the list of remaining items is still not 100% determined at this point, I'm sure we'll end up talking about it in an article later this month. Until then, enjoy the candy, and that wicked sick Fleet Carrier event.

                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following update on Wednesday, September 21, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.

Hitching Fixes
* We've identified and resolved areas that cause hitching to take place during and after new dynamic instances (like the tutorial and Nexus) spin up.
* These changes should also help the long-term health of the server when it has gone for long periods without being restarted.
* We'll continue additional investigation as needed, should problems arise over the weekend.
Outfit Wars
* Player counts of each team are now surfaced during the warmup phase while on Nexus.
* The "Join Match" button now becomes disabled and displays information when your outfit has reached the maximum number of members in a match.
                                
                                                                                           
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following update on Thursday, September 8, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). The downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.
--


Outfit Wars
* Fixed many issues related to the tinting options in Outfit Wars.
* When the warmup ends, it no longer prevents the start of the next alert's fanfare from playing.
* Fixed an issue with Cobalt's Outfit Wars displaying incorrect leaderboard information.
* Global ranking should now display the correct numbers next to each Outfit's name.
* Owning more territory than the opposing faction when they have taken your Warpgate base no longer displays the incorrect victors when the alert ends.
* Temporarily disabled Overseer speech from Outfit Wars facility capture/defend notifications.
* You now receive an error message when clicking the Join Match button on an account that is ineligible to participate in the war, eg. when you attempt to participate in multiple wars on the same server...
Dev Note: We're aware of some hitching taking place during match times last weekend and will be gathering more information on Friday in the case that it occurs again.


Observer Camera
* Observer cameras now have better spawn locations on Nexus.
* You can no longer redeploy from the observer camera while on Nexus.
* The new command "/ow observeend" will cease observing an Outfit Wars match.
* You can no longer "/ow observematch" a match your Outfit is participating in.
Dev Note: We didn't see any malicious use of observer camera in the last round, but these changes were on our to-do list to prevent it as a future possibility.




Sudden Death Alerts
* Added a new "Sudden Death" alert type that now triggers when a Meltdown alert becomes a Draw.
* The first faction to kill 10,000 enemies, or whichever team has the most kills at the end of this 15 minute alert, will lock the continent in their favor.
* If this alert somehow ends in a tie... another Sudden Death alert will trigger.
* Victorious factions will win rewards equivalent to the current Meltdown alert losses, and losing factions receive no rewards.
* Metagame event ids for Census API are as follows: 236, 237, 238, 239, 240 (Indar, Hossin, Amerish, Esamir, and Oshur respectively)
Dev Note: The intention of these alerts are to improve upon the "coinflip" Draw mechanics that previously existed, and simultaneously fix a bug that was introduced in the last update that prevented said coinflips from occurring.




Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* NS-11C and variants now have 3 underbarrel grenades, instead of 2.
* NSO Auraxium weapons now use the correct weapon ribbon icons.
* Refunded and have hidden the Chimera's incomplete "Power Spike" skill line.
                                
                                                                                           
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following update on Wednesday, August 31, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). The extended downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.

Outfit Wars
Last weekend's Outfit Wars test identified a handful of issues that we've fixed in this release. On top of that, there has been some confusion on Live caused about match times due to the UI pointing to a couple of different data-sources when trying to display them to the player. This should be resolved, and when the Wednesday match time hits, all of the match times will be in sync with when your matches are actually taking place, and relogging will no longer cause match times to appear blank in the standings screen.


HUD team color indicators are also in a much better place, now allowing for the same level of control you had in the sandbox, while being specific to Outfit Wars.


Players will no longer be able to join a match after the Warmup (as originally intended,) or rejoin a match that they have left or been disconnected from. Lastly, players who leave an outfit mid-match will also be kicked from the matchup. These changes address a variety of exploits surfaced by players during the test.




Observer Camera Changes
The following changes impact accounts with observer camera access.
* Using "/ow observematch matchrank" will take you to an active Outfit Wars match. The matchrank is the rank listed on the Outfit War standings screen.
* When in an Outfit Wars match, you will be unable to leave the camera without redeploying to a new zone.
* Players in an observer camera when they log out will be placed in Sanctuary upon relogging.




Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* NS Scorpion now drops bomblets again.
* Lights no longer flicker on medium graphics quality settings.
* Decoy Grenade now has a unique model.
* UI.Ok is now okay.
* "team_id" has now been exposed in the Census API.
* Javelin once again shows thrust FX in all correct movement states.
* Chimera no longer loses idle FX the moment it starts moving.
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following update on Wednesday, August 24, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). The extended downtime for this update is expected to last up to 3 hours.


Additionally, website and Census API features are likely to be offline during a backend maintenance from 10:00am PT (7:00pm CEST) to 12:00pm PT (9:00pm CEST).

* Teleporters in each faction's Embassy room on Sanctuary are operable once again.
* Fixed a missing icon for the ANT in the My Character page.
* Extended Magazine for the MGR-A1 Vanquisher now provides 6 rounds, instead of 5.
* Pilot pistols of all variants now eject shell casings when no barrel, or a compensator, is equipped.
* NS-7 "Assassin" PDW's shell casings now eject while a suppressor is attached.
* NSO characters will no longer destroy their own deployables with ElectroTech, Disruptor rounds, and similar effects.
* "Gift" button no longer appears on depot items marked as unavailable.
                                
                                                                                           
        All PC servers will come down for the following update on Wednesday, August 17, at 5:30am PT (2:30pm CEST). The extended downtime for this update is expected to last up to 5 hours.

Balance Adjustments
LA60 Masthead (NC Anti-Materiel Rifle)
* Flak Detonation distance from 4m to 2m.
* Crouchwalk and Standing Hipfire CoF from 2.25 to 3.5
* Crouching Hipfire CoF from 1.25 to 3
* Walking Hipfire CoF from 3.5 to 4.5
Dev Note: These changes are meant to increase the precision required to deliver the damage the Masthead is capable of.


Pelter Rocket Pod (Valkyrie)
* Magazine size from 10 to 8.
Dev Note: Mag size nerfs for weapons with limited mag sizes tend to swing the effectiveness of a weapon pretty heavily, but it's likely there will still need to be follow-up tuning to find a good middle-ground where this weapon should live.




Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* Addressed hitching-related issues by streamlining garbage collection, these changes should help reduce hitching beyond only Amerish.
* Fixed an issue causing small white lights to occasionally appear and flicker around the screen.
* Updated NS-45 "Assassin" Pilot with the correct models for Suppressor and Darklight.

Surf and Storm
All aboard! The Surf and Storm update is finally here -- bringing with it the first-ever water vehicle, major updates to the island continent of Oshur, a whole new style of gameplay underwater, the second leg of our summer event directives, and a whole host of fixes and improvements. Check it out below!
   





A Gift for All
To celebrate the release of Surf and Storm, we're giving away a platinum version of the UBR-300 Swordfish! Just redeem SURF2022 after the update goes Live!
   



Corsair
Navigate the island chain of Oshur with our very first naval vessel, the Corsair assault craft. This vehicle is available on the islands of Oshur, and can be pulled from any Flotilla or Seapost. One driver, two gunners, and up to five additional passengers can assault the sea or shore with this powerful addition to your empire's arsenal.






Armament
* Utility: Fire Suppression, IR Chaff
* Defense: Nanite Auto-Repair, Proximity Repair, Proximity Ammo Dispenser
* Chassis: Speed Chassis, Scout Chassis, Agility Chassis
* Weapons: M20 Basilisk, M60 Bulldog, Dingo ML-6, C2-20 HCG (NSO), M18 Palisade-C (TR), N30 Trawler-C (NC), V42 Pariah-C (VS)
* Special: Squad-spawn capable, Catapult System
Catapult System
Spawn in your squadmates, then launch them into battle using the Catapult System. Passengers in the last 5 seats can charge the power meter, and launch themselves like a cannonball in their facing direction!


Cosmetics
The initial release of the Corsair has a handful of horns, exterior, cockpit, and lumifibers available!
   





Oshur
The island continent of Oshur has been heavily revised to include the flow of new bases, a new lattice, and new underwater combat.


Flotilla and Lattice
* Each Flotilla has been relocated, and their starting lattice/region control has been adjusted to allow for more fight locations throughout Oshur.
* Updated map and lattice is as shown below.
   



Victory Conditions
* Triggering a Meltdown event on Oshur now requires 5 major facilities controlled, and no longer awards linking of Warpgates.
* Population-based Meltdown alerts trigger as usual whenever the appropriate amount of players are available in the zone.
Seaposts
* Seaposts have been revisited as a base archetype, and a total of 10 have been added to Oshur.
* Each Seapost now has a smaller footprint, attached spawn point, and the ability to pull a Corsair from the attached waterdock.
* The position of these Seaposts allow for more lattice lane variability, and new ways to cut off enemy territory.
* Nine of the new Seaposts now have underwater single-point combat areas, each with a unique design.
* Seapost D8 - Collapse is a derelict aquatic research site.
* Seapost G8 - Pipeline is the site of a sabotaged pipe network.
* Seapost G6 - Trenches covers deep grooves in the ground.
* Seapost J7 - Garden is an open coral/rock garden.
* Seapost L8 - Cliffdive is settled beneath a cliff's edge.
* Seapost J8 - Delve is an underground cave network.
* Seapost I11 - Stones is surrounded by teethlike spires of rock.
* Seapost G11 - Reef is a coral reef with gentle line of sight breaks.
* Seapost H10 - Debris seems to be the site of a few failed delivery attempts.
* The pre-existing Seaposts, and one located near the Northeast Flotilla, have floating vehicle capture points.
* Seaposts now have a new base icon to indicate the water-based nature of the outpost.
Bridges
* Many of the low bridges on Oshur have been removed or made passable to facilitate movement of Corsairs through the map.
Bathala Nursery
* This is a new underwater base in the center of the map, meant as a transitional combat area between the larger center bases.
HMS Technologies
* A large single-point base has been added to the large northwestern island.
K&H Tech Station
* This base has been reworked, and is no longer an open-field construction base.
Mirror Bay Watchtower
* Moved A and C control points into open fields near the base, where attackers tend to congregate.
* B point has received adjusted entrances for flow, and larger control point capture area.
Centri Mining Operation
* Now has an updated northern entrance to create less of a choke, and better Sunderer placement.
* Has a sweet bridge jump just north of the base.
Veridad Pass
* This open field base has received more cover placement.
Outpost Kalis
* Fixed a missing Sunderer Garage shield.
Sage R&D
* Ammo tower at Sage R&D is now functional.
Underwater Combat
Major changes have been made to facilitate combat beneath the waves.
* Movement speed penalty while underwater dropped from 60% to 45%.
* Most infantry/MAX small-arms that do not deal explosive or anti-armor damage can now be fired underwater. Attachments that enable explosive damage will prevent these weapons from firing underwater as well.
* Many deployables, like mines and C4 are still able to be placed underwater, though ability usage is limited in scope.
* Underwater weapons still have the lowest projectile drag, and effectively the furthest range when fighting underwater.
* Lodestar's shield no longer activates when deployed underwater.


Diver Propulsion Device
* Cruise around the Oshur seabed with the new Diver Propulsion Device! While held, pressing spacebar will allow you move through the water with ease.
* The Diver Propulsion Device is available for certification points, and can be found in the Tactical Slot of all non-Light Assault classes.
   





Summer Directive - Wave Breaker (July 13 - July 27)
* Make a splash with the second summer directive!
* Completing this directive unlocks the UBP-1 "Steel" Starfish to aid in your underwater escapades.
   





Maximum Pressure Returns! (July 13 - July 27)
* For a limited time, the Maximum Pressure event makes its way back to Auraxis.
* Once per continent, this event can trigger, eliminating the cost of MAX units for the duration.
* Whichever team kills the most enemies during the alert will be victorious!
Outfit Wars Returns! (Enlistment begins Aug. 03)
* Outfit Wars is a tournament-style event where Outfits work their way up the ranking ladder over the course of a season.
* This year, we'll be conducting Outfit Wars in a new 1v1 format taking place on the icy battle island of Nexus.
* Outfits who sign up will bring a platoon of their most talented players into the match with them, and do battle through a 45 minute alert.
* Hold the most territory for the duration of the alert, or cut off a faction's Warpgate to win.
* Each match has a limited pool of "bracket points" that can be earned by holding territory through the match. These points will break win/loss record ties, and help your Outfit climb the ladder.
* More information to come once we're a bit closer to the day.

* Fixed a missing vehicle description on the ANT.
Looking Forward
When Oshur was first teased, the community clamored for underwater combat, and I definitely wanted it, too. There was a lot of new going on around that time period: new tech, new ideas, new continent. There was no way we could have pulled the trigger then. The sheer volume of unproven mechanics, necessary FX, audio, playspace additions, and the unanswered question of whether underwater combat would even be fun – it would have been an insurmountable request. Happy to say though that, while Oshur isn't everyone's cup of tea, the way it reignited our players' most nostalgic memories of earliest days of this game was inspiring. It was a goal we aimed to hit, and your response gave us enough confidence to keep moving in this direction.


PlanetSide 2 has always been about massive scale, combined arms, and the awe and excitement that these elements can create. Over time players will exchange excitement for efficiency, as they settle into a game's rhythm – it happens with any gaming community that's been around for long enough... But one thing (I hope) I've learned over the past 6 years as a team member, is that the original dream, promise, or memory, maybe, is the true heart of the game. Any time we can bring back that childlike wonder, when everything was fresh, and new, and unexplored, feels like a goal worthy of developing for, and I hope this update finds some of that for you again.

                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following update on Wednesday, June 29, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). Downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.

* The AE variant of the Artemis VX26 now has the attachments it was missing from the base weapon.
* ANT's Deliverer Module no longer conflicts with Rival Combat Chassis.
* ANT no longer displays two entries of the NS-A Horn.
* Sniper Rifle resist type no longer damages Hardlight Barriers.
* Fixed an issue where the Friendly Fire audio could spam suddenly on Oshur.
* The radar dishes on Exodus Fleet Carriers no longer has missing textures.
* Updated tooltip for Cortium Bombs.
* Fixed LOD issues with the Reaver Dragonfly cosmetics.
Looking Forward
With the network performance issues that have been plaguing Connery past us, and the G15 errors few and far between, we can start talking about some of the fun summer updates we've got planned with a little more confidence. The gifting system going Live with this update is kind of a big deal in terms of a technological addition, and has been a requested feature for about as long as I can remember. Hopefully the folks who are looking to make use of it are a little happier with the addition. To look at what's coming down the pipe, the new water vehicle is just on the horizon, and Outfit Wars in a 1v1 capacity is getting pretty near as well. We'll talk about some of this in the next dev article, and share some insight into where we're headed. To the folks affected by the server troubles the past few months (and everyone else who had to hear about it,) thank you for bearing with us.


                                                                                   
                                                                                                  
                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following changes on Wednesday, May 25, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). Downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.

New to the Arsenal


Empire-Specific Anti-Materiel Rifles
New Anti-Materiel Rifles are now available for each faction. With long-range optics and damage models befitting longer-range engagements, these rifles add a deadly new angle to your Engineer's toolkit.


DAGR-81 (Terran Republic) - An infantryman's answer to long-range vehicle opposition, with a quick rechamber and large magazine for sustained fire.
   



VX4-3 Slicer (Vanu Sovereignty) - This anti-materiel rifle delay-fires a plasma blade that rips through organic material on its way to striking heavily armored targets.
   



LA60 Masthead (New Conglomerate) - A hard-hitting anti-materiel rifle that deploys a flak payload when dealing with aircraft.
   



NE-36 Linecutter (Nanite Systems Operatives) - In addition to a balanced magazine, reload, and damage, this anti-materiel rifle can also prevent MAX units and infantry deployables from receiving repairs.
   



Infantry Balance


NS-AM7 Archer
* Hipfire CoF bloom from 0.6 to 1.
* ADS CoF bloom from 1 to 0.6.
* ADS movement speed multiplier from 0.75x to 0.5x.
Dev Note: With the increased power provided by the last major update, this weapon's ADS mobility is higher than it needed to be. The Black Market Shortbow has kept this trait, however. The CoF value adjustments are mainly an error correction between the two firing states.


Directives
* A new Exceptional VI directive line has been added. Much of the weapons offered in the Legacy update, including the new "Apex" weapons, contribute to this directive's progress.
* Anti-Materiel Rifle kills have been added as an option to the Engineer's Directive line.
* Fixed an issue where Spitfire Auto-Turret and Anti-Vehicle Mana Turrets could not allow Engineer directive progress, or show as disabled.
User Interface


Main Navigation Menu
The Main Nav Menu has received many updates based on player feedback.


We've moved the Settings, Support, and Codex buttons out of the dropdown menu and into the lower-right hand corner; currencies are now readily visible in the upper-right area without a dropdown; and the logout button now prompts you to either return to the character select screen, or exit the game entirely. Many reported bugs have been resolved and refinements have been made as well.


Additionally, you can now bind a hotkey that will bring up the Settings menu.


   



HUD Indicator Options
As shown in the screenshot above, we've added the option to turn off many of the HUD indicators in the game, and can be seen through its own pane in the Settings menu.


We're currently exploring options for differentiating some of the categories into friend/foe, but until then, many of the game's HUD indicators can be disabled to tailor the amount of on-screen clutter.


Spawn Changes (Likely Temporary)


When we first launched Oshur, we reverted to some legacy spawn rules with a little less restriction than they had. The intention there was to reduce performance overhead, while encouraging more logistical gameplay. With our investigation of the server performance issues ongoing, we'd like to revert back to the legacy ruleset, but with major reductions in the restrictions so that we don't end up in the situation we had with Oshur.


The outcome of these changes is that all of the valid hardspawns on the map will pop at the same time, instead of bringing them online based on the ideal combat zones we'd like to send you to. Vehicle spawn points will activate slightly faster. Ideally this would provide some information for us, and a more performant server for all of you while we continue our investigation.


Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions


* Fixed an issue with Darklight Flashlights revealing cloaks in first person from any distance.
* Fixed a camera issue with the DV-XAT on the Dervish.
* Fixed animation and VFX issues associated with the DV-22T Lightweaver.
* Fixed an exploit with the Spitfire Turret.
* Fixed various issues related to the NS-66 Bumblebee.
* Explosive damage once again works in VR Training, but you'll likely see the return of fidgeting VR training targets as a result.
* Heavy Crossbows now appear in the My Stats screen.
* Fixed typos associated with some Heavy Magazine attachment descriptions.
* You can now filter infantry weapons for Anti-Materiel Rifles in the Depot.
* Added new loading screen tooltips.
* Critical Chain now works with the NS-AM8 Shortbow.
* Magrider's turbo costs have been adjusted to return the vehicle to expected performance levels.
                                
                                                                                           
                                                                                   
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will be offline for the following update, May 04, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). Downtime is expected to last up to two hours.

Notes on Network Issues
Connery Latency Issues: As of 10:30pm PT, May. 02, we have made revisions to the network infrastructure surrounding the Connery server. The goal with these changes are to, at minimum, cross certain factors off our list during the investigation into Connery's latency problems. The best case scenario would be that the changes resolve the current issues.


We'd like to encourage folks to play on Connery tonight (and post update) and send CS report tickets for issues if they continue to occur (https://help.daybreakgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). As a reminder, we're looking for your character name, server, time of incident, ISP, and PC specs.


G15 errors: As of this update, all gateways will have received the modifications discussed in the recent dev letter. The G15 issues continue to be investigated, but they should be less frequent overall, and keep impacted players out of the game for less time as well.




Codex System and Main Navigation
In this release, we've made a variety of updates to the UI, including an all-new Codex System that acts as an in-game wiki for mechanics, lore, and other useful knowledge. This new screen is accessible from the "hamburger menu" dropdown in the top-right corner.


The Main Navigation menu has also received a number of changes to modernize the look. The top right corner houses boosts, currency, and settings options, while the top left shows your player-card, experience to next level, and directive score. Additionally, the directive score can be clicked on to send you right to the Directives page (without going through Missions or Campaign,) and clicking elsewhere on the player-card will send you to the My Character screen where you can customize your profile banner, title, and more.


   





VS Directive Weapon Adjustments
Updates to usability here bridge the gap between what felt off about the first pass, and how we'd like these weapons to perform overall. Heat weapons don't use traditional short/long reloads, and only use their overheat value for a reload (this is an unresolved issue with all heat weapons with a manual reload,) and we've brought the directive weapon overheat values in line with those weapons' short reloads.


Darkstar (VS Assault Rifle)
* Reload/Overheat penalty from 2.2sec. to 1.75sec.
* Shots until overheat from 24 to 27.
Eclipse VE3A (VS Carbine)
* Reload/Overheat penalty from 2.28sec. to 1.65sec.
* Shots until overheat from 24 to 27.
The Immortal (VS Sidearm)
* Reload/Overheat penalty from 1.75sec. to 1.45sec.
* Shots before overheat from 14 to 16.
Revenant (VS Scout Rifle)
* Reload/Overheat penalty from 2.6sec. to 2sec.
* Shots before overheat from 16 to 18.
* Fixed an issue with the audio playing the "low ammo warning" when firing.
Parsec VX3-A (VS Sniper Rifle)
* Reload/Overheat penalty from 5.575sec. to 3.86sec.
Chaos (VS Shotgun)
* Reload/Overheat penalty from 3.22sec. to 2.1sec.
* Shots before overheat from 6 to 7
Skorpios (VS SMG)
* Reload/Overheat penalty remains at 1.74sec.
* Shots before overheat from 20 to 25.
Dev Note: To replace some of the built-in function of the previous Vented Power Core, it's been given minor mag size benefit despite the heat standardization, and kept the added recoil penalty from Vented Power Core in exchange.


Betelgeuse 54-A (VS LMG)
* Reload/Overheat penalty from 3.44 to 3sec.
* Shots before overheat from 40 to 45.
Dev Note: Realistically, the Betelgeuse didn't need any buffs, and this change is only to bring back a portion of its "LMG high-mag" feel, that was remarked on as missing by players. It may receive drawbacks in other areas in the future.






Explosive Ammunition
Explosive Ammunition now has a standardized effect, impacting the following TR weapons: HBR-1 Dragoon, DMR-99, and HSR-1
* Now converts 125 direct damage into 100 explosive damage over 2 meters for all affected weapons.
* Minimum blast damage from 1 to 25.
* Bonus friendly-fire damage reduction from 75% to 50%. This effect stacks multiplicatively with the baseline 50% damage reduction applied to all non-squad friendly fire.
* Explosive Ammunition now has new impact effect visuals.
Dev Note: Previously, Explosive Ammunition dropped the Dragoon's 334 direct damage to 250, and added 75 splash over 2 meters (it was stated incorrectly as 1.5 meters in the tooltip.) For non-Dragoon weapons, the effect was the same, effectively boosting the damage of those weapons to silly levels.






Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* Added a setting option that can disable melee weapons from being auto-wielded when the melee key is held down.
* Same-faction targets no longer appear in the firing lanes in VR Training, but still appear out in the field.
* Defectors can no longer hit themselves when firing through the Seraph Shield.
* Added underbarrels to many weapons that were intended to receive them during the Arsenal Update.
* Tactical Grenades/Mines now show "Assists to Next" instead of "Kills to Next" and are capable of earning assist ribbons.
* The Oshur "Underwater Travel" directive no longer shows numbers that exceeds the display, and instead counts to 5000 hectometers (100 meters per 1 point.)
* ANTs with the Deliverer Module equipped now earn spawn experience.
* The A2-20 HCG for the NSO ANT can now unlock the Ammunition Capacity cert line.
* Chimera CT2-20 HCG barrels now animate when firing.
* Fixed audio and FX issues related to the HCG.
* Holding down the afterburner key while your energy is regenerating will once again apply boost when you gain enough energy.
* You should no longer be able to achieve infinite afterburners.
* You can once again see afterburner FX from Interceptors deployed by the Bastion Fleet Carrier.
* Fortify implant now provides the 20% small arms resistance as described, and no longer protects from sniper rifles.
* Underwater Weapons category has been renamed to Amphibious Rifles and Amphibious Sidearms, where applicable.
* The Brawler's Extended Magazine no longer conflicts with optics.
* Viridian Genetics Lab's Ammunition Tower now provides ammunition.
* Concussion Mines no longer causes a second placed mine to remove the first.
* Exodus Flotilla Cannons no longer fire upon allied NSO Flash and Javelins.
* Fixed various underbarrel related issues.
* Adrenaline Shield's upgrade descriptions no longer differ from the ability's actual description.
                                
                                                                                           
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will be offline for the following update, Apr. 05, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). Downtime is expected to last up to two hours.

Notes on Server/Client Performance
Periodic Hitching: Hitching should be resolved with this update's downtime. With last week's repeated rolling zone restarts, the expectation is that we introduced a mismatch between data on certain environments that was causing the hitching. (Side note: This issue has nothing to do with the nanite timer, as some have theorized.)


G15 errors: We're currently experiencing intermittent issues with gateways getting into a bad state. Sometimes a gateway will stop letting traffic through, which means that certain people won't be able to reach the server (resulting in the G15 error.) Those bad gateways need to be restarted manually after a problem is identified. We've added additional logging to the Live environment that will help us diagnose the cause of these gateway collapses. We're trying to stay on top of these problems as best as our current resources allow, but we can look for a more permanent fix once the data comes in.


Connery Server Latency: We're aware of extremely high latency for players connecting to Connery from Asia and Australia. This may be due to routing issues from those environments. It would be extremely helpful if you could submit tickets to CS through this portal: https://help.daybreakgames.com/hc/en-us/categories/204228447-PLANETSIDE-2


We need your character name, server, the time of the incident, ISP, and PC specs if possible. CS will work with you if they need more specific information beyond that point. I realize there is a lot of friction associated with this process, but if we can find the exact jumps where these slowdowns occur, we can work with network providers to try to circumvent these problem areas. Fixing this issue for one person tends to fix it for many people, so thank you in advance for those of you submitting tickets.


High-Pop Performance Issues: We continue to investigate how we can make the high-pop server performance better, but the analysis done until this point mainly points to it being something we need to address from a gameplay side. Reintroducing the spawn priority system has certainly increased the performance overhead, and we're looking at ways to make that less cost intensive. (As a refresher: We initially disabled this system with Oshur's release, but using the more efficient pre-2019 spawn system garnered a lot of negative feedback on non-Oshur continents.) Alternatively, we can reduce the maximum populations on a continent, as performance tends see a negative impact beyond 750ish players. That's probably the least favorable bullet we have in the chamber, as it doesn't truly solve problems when players are all clumped up in the same location. Long story short, we're not ignoring these issues, there just aren't great answers at the moment.


Double Experience Weekend Two, Electric Boogaloo
Because our last double experience weekend was riddled with server issues, we're going to run another one this weekend. The hope is that we have performance issues hammered out by then.
Double experience for ALL players will take place Apr. 08, 09, and 10.




Balance Adjustments
* Semi-auto shotguns now use the same Slug Ammunition as automatic shotguns, changing their damage from 600-400 to 450-300. (This value was mistakenly shown as 475 damage before, both in-game and patch notes, that's been remedied as well.)
* 19A Fortuna, CB-ARX Newton, TRAC-Shot, Eclipse VE3A now all have access to Soft Point Ammunition.
Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions
* Compensators for the Eclipse VE3A, TRAC-Shot, and 19A Fortuna now operate as expected.
* NSO's HCG turrets no longer have view model issues in first person while looking up.
* Heavy Magazine attachment no longer prevents rail attachments from being equipped on weapons that were affected by this bug.
* Heavy Magazine attachment no longer increases the magazine size of underbarrel grenade launchers.
* Compensator's attachment description has been updated, and properly conveys the increased hipfire penalty.
* NS-45P Pilot now has compensator and flash suppressor like it's base weapon counterpart.
* Havoc Mines no longer show the tactical grenade indicator above them.
* Mines added in the last update no longer stick to surfaces.
* Updated the cert line description of Nano-armor Cloaking.
* EMP, Flash, Concussion, and Havoc grenades now all grant assist experience.
* Equipping a laser sight on the "Treasured" LA1 Anchor no longer conflicts with barrel attachments.
* MG-A1 Arbalest now has proper barrel attachment models.
* Earning a Flashbang Mine medal no longer also grants a Flashbang Grenade medal.
* The My Stats page have had the missing grenades added to it.
                                
                                                                                                             
                                                                          
                                                                                 All PC servers will be offline for the following update, Mar. 30, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). Downtime is expected to last up to two hours.

The Arsenal Update
With this massive update, we've re-tuned many weapons, added more than 800 weapon attachments, revisited aspects of vehicle and infantry balance, and added new equipment that will expand your combat capabilities. Brace yourself for some very, very long patch notes.


NSO Legacy Outfits
When NSO went free to play (and received a revamped arsenal, new vehicles, and the ability to permanently align with a home faction,) in summer of last year, we mentioned allowing existing NSO outfits to migrate their members to a home faction, instead of having to disband and reform the outfit. This functionality has finally arrived, and the handful of legacy NSO outfits that are still holding on can properly migrate to a separate faction. NSO players without active memberships will remain in Freelancer status (functionality fixed in this update,) and will not be booted from their existing Outfit if membership lapses. Leaders of legacy NSO Outfits can now permanently align their Outfit to a home faction by speaking to Emerson on Sanctuary. This is a one-time transaction that will cause all the current members in our Outfit to move to the selected faction. Members who are online will need to relog (or re-zone into Sanctuary) for their home faction to be updated proper.


Black Market
In celebration of the Arsenal Update, FL-34 and SPRK-33 got some new digs on Sanctuary. You can visit them in the same spot they've been holding down, but now with a totally new look. Additionally...

   * All Black Market weapons are now purchasable with Daybreak Cash, as an alternative to the normal A7 currency costs.
   * A new "Black Market" directive can be found in the Specialty directive tree. Progress through this tree by showing your expertise with Black Market weapons.
   * New to the Black Market: SPRK-33's Stomper - This heavily modified Thumper fires anti-vehicle sabot rounds capable of shredding enemy armor over moderate distances.
1.    
The new Black Market directive, with new banner and Punisher variant rewards.


New Faction-specific Mines
Tactical mine options have been added to each faction to add more defensive layers during point defense.
Flashbang Mine (VS only)

   * Vanu Sovereignty Infiltrators and Engineers now have access to the new Flashbang Mine.
   * Flashbang Mines blind enemies within 12m when triggered.
   2. EMP Mine (NC only)

      * New Conglomerate Infiltrators and Engineers now have access to the new EMP Mine.
      * EMP Mines deplete shields and scramble the HUD of infantry within 12m, as well as destroy or disable deployables caught in the blast.
      3. Concussion Mine (TR only)

         * Terran Republic Infiltrators and Engineers now have access to the new Concussion Mine.
         * Concussion Mines slow and disorient enemies within 12m when triggered.
         4. Havoc Mine (NSO only)

            * NSO Infiltrators and Engineers now have access to the new Havoc Mine.
            * Havoc Mines prevent repairs of mechanical targets within a 12m radius when triggered.
            * These mines only trigger when vehicles or MAX units come within range (or are destroyed.)
            5. New Class-specific Grenades
Cleansing Grenade (Combat Medic only)

               * Combat Medics now have access to the new Cleansing Grenade.
               * Cleansing Grenades detonate on impact, removing most status effects and healing 100hp/sec. for 3sec.
               6. Havoc Grenade (Heavy Assault only)

                  * Heavy Assault now have access to the new Havoc Grenade.
                  * Havoc Grenades detonate on impact in an 8m radius, preventing repairs for 6sec.
                  7. Timed EMP (Infiltrator only)

                     * Infiltrators now have access to the new Timed EMP grenade.
                     * Timed EMPs detonate after 3 seconds in a 10m radius, depleting shields and scrambling the HUD.
                     8. Impulse Grenade (Light Assault only)

                        * Light Assault now have access to the new Impulse Grenade.
                        * Impulse Grenades detonate on impact in a 5m radius, knocking back enemies or yourself.
                        * When used on enemies, the knockback is less extreme than when used to propel yourself.
                        9. Grenade Balance and UI
General

                           * A new HUD grenade warning indicator has been added for offensive tactical grenades like Flash and Concussion Grenades.
                           * Detonation visuals for EMP, Flash, and Concussion Grenades have been updated.
                           * Targets who are Flashed or Concussed now display small debuff visuals.
                           10. Concussion Grenade

                              * Effective radius from 12m to 10m.
                              11. Flash/Quick-Det Flash Grenade

                                 * Effective radius from 12m to 10m.
                                 12. EMP Grenade

                                    * Effective radius from 15m to 10m. (Dev Note: You should still have no problem hitting spawn beacons.)
                                    13. Nanite Healing Grenade

                                       * Renamed to Nano-Regen Grenade.
                                       * Healing over time from 150hp/sec. to 175hp/sec.

New empire-specific "Basilisk" (jack-of-all-trades) top gun options have made their way to the game. These new weapons have statistical variations that set them apart from the common pool Basilisk, and will be available on multiple vehicles. The Prowler, Vanguard, and Magrider will receive these new weapons as a part of the default equipment, and the Sunderer, ANT, and Harasser will be capable of unlocking them as an option.

N30 Trawler (New Conglomerate)
The Trawler is a slow firing, 30mm heavy machine gun that dishes out heavy damage over short distances.
   

M18 Palisade (Terran Republic)
The M18 Palisade increases rate of fire over the first second, unleashing a barrage of machine gun rounds from its large magazine.
   

V42 Pariah (Vanu Sovereignty)
The Pariah is a stable, rapid fire plasma platform that offers consistent high-caliber damage over even long-range engagements.
   


Vehicle Adjustments
General

                                          * Tank shell tracers have received new visuals.
                                          16. Reload Speed Certification Lines

                                             * The reload speed certification lines for main cannons, noseguns, ESF wing mounts, Liberator bellyguns, and Flash weapons have been standardized at 5/7/8.5/9.5/10% reload speed.
                                             * The reload speed certification lines for top guns, air vehicle non-nosegun (and non-bellygun) weapons have been standardized at 10/14/17/19/20% reload speed.
                                             * Weapons with no magazine size option are an exception to the above, and remain at the 10% reload speed cap (Halberd and Gatekeeper, as examples.)
                                             17. Dev Note: In many, but not all cases, this is a buff to the reload speed cert line, with bigger gains at lower levels to increase accessibility to newer players.

Chimera
The changes here help compensate for the Chimera being a larger target, and give the non-Satyr main cannons more presence on the battlefield.
General

                                                * Chimera Health from 5000 to 5500
                                                18. CT-135 (Chimera Main Cannon)

                                                   * Direct damage from 550 to 600
                                                   * Reload speed from 2.5sec. to 2.25sec.
                                                   19. CT-150 Cyclops (Chimera Main Cannon)

                                                      * Direct damage from 800 to 900
                                                      20. HCG-20 (Chimera Forward Turret)

                                                         * Projectile velocity from 550 to 650
                                                         * Max damage range from 10m to 50m
                                                         * Min damage range from 100m to 250m
                                                         * Min damage from 167 to 143
                                                         * Refire rate from 150ms to 171ms
                                                         * Now has an Extended Magazine certification line.
                                                         21. Dev Note: Since the Chimera already had a unique "Basilisk" weapon, it's received some adjustments to set it apart. These weapons are now unlockable on the Harasser/ANT/Sunderer as well.

Valkyrie
Changes below help move the Valkyrie a bit further away from piñata territory by increasing its overall movement capabilities and its anti-vehicle effectiveness with non-VLG weaponry.
General

                                                            * Increased forward speed by roughly 25kph.
                                                            * Increased downward thrust speed.
                                                            * Increased forward and rise acceleration.
                                                            * Increased braking capabilities.
                                                            * Tank shell resist from -65 to -80
                                                            22. Wyvern

                                                               * Damage resist type from 28 (Armor Piercing Chaingun) to 4 (Heavy Machine Gun)
                                                               * Minimum damage from 143 to 150
                                                               * Minimum damage range from 100m to 200m
                                                               * Reserve ammunition from 300 to 480
                                                               23. Pelter Rocket Pods

                                                                  * Reload speed from 3.5sec. to 2.25sec.
                                                                  * Direct damage from 125 to 145
                                                                  * Reserve ammunition from 100 to 200
                                                                  24. Hellion G20

                                                                     * Magazine size from 60 to 90
                                                                     * Reserve ammunition from 450 to 720
                                                                     25. 
Sunderer

                                                                        * Deploy Shield now uses hex shield visuals to show when it's active.
                                                                        * Basilisk (top guns) refire rate from 171ms to 150ms
                                                                        26. Dev Note: The refire changes revert a long-standing adjustment that left Sunderer Basilisks less powerful than vehicles with only a single top gun. Reverting this renews the possibility of battle bus tactics.

ANT

                                                                           * Added Deliverer Module as a defensive slot option.
                                                                           * Deliverer Module passively dispenses ammunition to nearby vehicles, and acts as a global spawn point while deployed. Additionally, The Deliverer Module allows Squad Members to spawn directly into the vehicle.
                                                                           27. 
Galaxy

                                                                              * Added the Lodestar Module as as defensive slot option.
                                                                              * Lodestar module now allows the Galaxy to deploy into a global spawn point, with a defensive shield layer and attached equipment terminals.
                                                                              28.

                                                                                 * Rank 1 Nanoweave now reduces Sniper Rifle (resist type 20) damage received by 20%, instead of Small Arms (resist type 2).
                                                                                 * No longer reduces movement speed.
                                                                                 30. Dev Note: As part of the ongoing experiments with Nanoweave, we're pulling off the movement speed reduction and moving the resistances of sniper rifles into their own category that can be contested by this armor. Sniper Rifles traditionally have a low skill floor for the bodyshot damage they put out (yet feel bad when they're not given enough bodyshot damage, Daimyo being a good example.) Pushing more of the focus subtly toward headshots through this method is something we'd like to explore.

Adrenaline Shield (Heavy Assault Ability)

                                                                                    * Reduced the energy return on kill from 31/35/38/41/44% to 15/18/21/23/25%.
                                                                                    31. Dev Note: Returning a couple hundred effective health after winning a firefight has more value than we were balancing against with previous numbers, the changes here reduce the effectiveness of Adrenaline Shield to make more room for alternatives.

Nano-Armor Cloaking (Infiltrator Ability)

                                                                                       * Removed the 100 extra shield provided by Nano-Armor Cloaking.
                                                                                       * The damage reduction from Nano-Armor Cloak is now 35% at all ranks, instead of just the last one.
                                                                                       32. Dev Note: Removing the extra 100 shield helps create more consistency surrounding weapons that should be able to one-shot an infiltrator (the Commissioner with a headshot, for example,) while ensuring, similar to Resist Shield, that the ability is active to receive benefits.

Symbiote (Implant)

                                                                                          * Healing provided by Symbiote's activation from 50 to 125.
                                                                                          * Added visual FX when healing is triggered.
                                                                                          * Damage taken while already at full health no longer triggers the healing effect, and thus the cooldown.
                                                                                          33. Dev Note: This bug above effectively broke the implant in the majority of situations you'd find yourself needing it to trigger, and we've increased the health return to a more noticeable amount as well.

Experimental Stims

                                                                                             * Now passively allows you to equip 1 additional stim (Restoration Kit, Medical Kit, or Infradine) on top of its previous benefits.
                                                                                             34. 
Broad Weapon Changes
This update includes many sweeping changes that will broadly impact the balance of certain weapon archetypes. The areas below will be broken down into groups to make it easier to digest.

Directive Weapons

                                                                                                * Enabled attachment customization on all applicable directive reward weapons.
                                                                                                * Directive weapons can now be used with the Advanced Specialization Program.
                                                                                                35. Dev Note: The changes above allow for customization of the weapons you've spent hundreds of hours working toward, and also factor into the subsequent balance adjustments that are made in each faction's weapon balance sections further down.

Sniper Rifles

                                                                                                   * Anti-infantry sniper rifles now use a separate Sniper Rifle resistance (type 20).
                                                                                                   * Being struck by a sniper rifle now has more prominent audio.
                                                                                                   36. Dev Note: The damage values for this new resistance are equivalent to small arms. This change will allow us to do is modify the bodyshot damage output from Nanoweave, as mentioned above.

Power Knives

                                                                                                      * Activated knife damage from 1050 to 900
                                                                                                      37. Dev Note: Power knives consistently kill with two shots to the body or one shot to the head. This change is meant to dampen the effectiveness of specific setups, and give players more time to react to the burst of damage when the user can't land a headshot.

Sidearms

                                                                                                         * Most sidearms now have their ADS CoF bloom set to half of their hipfire CoF bloom. Weapons impacted by this are noted further down.
                                                                                                         38. Dev Note: This is a subtle change that technically extends effective range, but won't be noticeable in most cases. More realistically, this change is closer to housekeeping.

Select Fire Modes

                                                                                                            * Select fire modes that aren't an important part of the weapon's capabilities have been removed.
                                                                                                            39. Dev Note: There are many weapons in the game that don't make use of their select-fire functionality, and realistically, it wouldn't make sense to try to tune all of that extra baggage to be useful. Removing the burst/semi-auto modes on weapons that don't lean on them will help streamline the weapon quality overall. Examples of weapons that make good use of alternate firemodes are the TRAP-M1, SABR-13, TS2 Inquisitor, LA3 Desperado, Phaseshift VX-S, etc.

Shotguns

                                                                                                               * Starting CoF for all shotguns is now 0.15 in all non-jumping/sprinting/falling movement states.
                                                                                                               * Pellet spread values while aiming and firing from the hip have been standardized using the wider hipfire values.
                                                                                                               * Cone of fire now blooms per shot by 0.3 from the hip, and 0.15 while aiming.
                                                                                                               40. Dev Note: The above changes aim to reduce the inconsistency and frustration of using these weapons, which was mainly caused by cone of fire spread stacked on top of the pellet spread. These changes are important when the new attachments and updated attachments come into play.

Attachment Changes
More than 800 new weapon attachments have been added, allowing for much more customizability. Those changes and additions can be found here, in quite possibly the most anxiety inducing way imaginable: https://imgur.com/a/zBKaoBw

 Slug Ammunition
Slug ammo now comes in 3 flavors with different damage ranges with independent hipfire cone of fire values. It's intended for semi-auto shotguns to be the most desirable to use with slug ammo, where others have steeper tradeoffs.

                                                                                                                  * 650-500 damage, pump shotguns.
                                                                                                                  * 600-400 damage, semi-auto shotguns.
                                                                                                                  * 475-300 damage, auto-shotguns.
                                                                                                                  41. 
Underbarrels

                                                                                                                     * Shortened the firemode switch timer for underbarrels from 0.8sec. to 0.4sec.
                                                                                                                     * Weapon equip time penalty for having an underbarrel equipped has been standardized at 0.25sec.
                                                                                                                     * (The above changes do not affect integrated underbarrels, like the one on the Punisher.)
                                                                                                                     42. Dev Note: The changes here are meant to reduce some of the clunkiness of Underbarrels in general.

Compensator

                                                                                                                        * Increased Compensator's vertical recoil reduction from 15% to 30%.
                                                                                                                        * Decreased Compensator's hipfire cone of fire penalty from 20% to 15%.
                                                                                                                        43. Dev Note: Compensators tend to be used less as players learn to control vertical recoil. These changes push the attachment closer to relevance for more setups and skill levels.

Forward Grips

                                                                                                                           * Advanced Forward Grips have all been converted to Forward Grips.
                                                                                                                           * The equip time penalty for these grips have been standardized to 0.15sec. across all weapons.
                                                                                                                           44. Dev Note: Advanced Forward Grips were previously given to weapons who already had top-tier horizontal recoil models, and the benefits of a grip far outweigh the drawbacks.

Laser Sights

                                                                                                                              * Advanced Laser Sights have all been converted to Laser Sights.
                                                                                                                              45. Dev Note: Like above, Advanced Laser Sights were typically given out to weapons that already had top-tier hipfire cone of fire, only furthering balance discrepancies. Unlike most attachments, laser sights don't have a real drawback beyond opportunity cost.

Comfort Grip

                                                                                                                                 * Penalty now increases vertical recoil by 20%, instead of increasing hipfire cone of fire by this amount.
                                                                                                                                 * Most Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, and Scout Rifles now use Comfort Grips, instead of Forward Grips.
                                                                                                                                 46. Dev Note: Traditional Forward Grips offered no functional benefits to slow firing semi-auto weapons, so swapping them for Comfort Grips (which reduce the equip and unequip time of a weapon,) can be interpreted as a buff in almost all cases.

Mobile Prediction Laser

                                                                                                                                    * An MPL now reduces vertical and horizontal recoil by 60% when fired from the hip, instead of reducing hipfire pellet spread.
                                                                                                                                    47. Dev Note: With the changes to cone of fire for shotguns, all shotgun laser sights have been converted to MPLs so that the attachment remains a relevant option for certain setups.

Disruptor Ammunition

                                                                                                                                       * Now reduces total per-shot damage by 20% at all ranges, and strips maximum shield energy on hit, instead of a flat value.
                                                                                                                                       * The amount of shield and energy stripped varies from weapon to weapon, this is unchanged.
                                                                                                                                       48. Dev Note: Overall this results in a buff to any weapon using Disruptor Ammunition, and further increases its effectiveness against enemies with higher-than-typical shield pools.

   

New Weapon Attachments

We've moved to a new formula for VS' heat-based weapons that are based on a non-heat based weapon. Adding a heat mechanic to a weapon now (in most cases) reduces the magazine size by 20% of the base weapon, heat recovery delay is now based on damage per magazine, heat bleed-off is based on a percentage of the long-reload of a weapon, and overheat penalties are now equivalent to the base weapon's long reload speed.

Additionally, reloading these weapons only makes use of their overheat penalties, instead of short and long reload times, and isn't affected by reload speed modifiers through implants or suit slots. This is a bug we caught too late into development to correct, and will need to be amended in a later update. Lastly, the changes below are very strict and will likely need tuning. We can take these weapons in a couple of different directions, but will need to observe Live conditions before choosing which path to take.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Laser Sight converted to MPL.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                83. Dev Note: Considerable buff to the Jackhammer's ability to reliably output damage, and carries over some of the sweeping shotgun changes were needed.

NC6S Gauss SAW S (NC LMG)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Max damage from 167@10m to 200@10m

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Refire rate from 104ms to 126ms
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Hipfire walk/stand/move starting CoF values increased by 0.25 (on par with the NC6 Gauss SAW.)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * ADS CoF bloom from 0.06 to 0.07
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   84. Dev Note: With there being as many flavors of 167 damage model weapons in the NC arsenal as there are, these changes provide a second 200 damage model option for LMGs. The Gauss SAW S mainly takes a small hit to refire rate and mag size for a faster reload and slightly more controllability.

EM1 (NC LMG)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Maximum ADS CoF to 1.2 in most states.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      85. Dev Note: Major buff that moves this support LMG in the direction of the Naginata and Promise while aiming down sights, without being quite as accurate as either.

Gauss Compact Burst (NC Carbine)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Renamed AF-20 Rogue.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         86. Dev Note: Gauss Compact Burst is actually a variant of the standard "Mercenary" carbine, and this naming convention fixes that.

Gauss Compact S (NC Carbine)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Renamed NC2 Gauss Compact.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            87. Dev Note: Similar thread here, the Gauss Compact S was a variant of the Mercenary, but without the "Select Fire" attributes, it's been renamed to something more fitting its nature.

MGR-C1 Charger (NC Carbine)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * When "uncharged" this weapon no longer drops to a 143 damage model, and instead scales back rate of fire.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Refire rate when uncharged from 92ms to 100ms
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               88. Dev Note: This is a significant buff to the weapon, as a 600rpm model (100ms refire) is near top-tier for the 167 damage category. This change also does away with shots to kill discrepancies that can be tied to bouncing between two damage models.

NC9 A-TROSS (NC Assault Rifle)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Refire rate from 128ms to 126ms
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  89. Dev Note: Small adjustment pushes the refire rate to 5% slower than the Reaper DMR, instead of the 7%ish it was at before.

Gauss Rifle S (NC Assault Rifle)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Short reload from 2.1sec. to 1.85sec.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Long reload from 2.8sec. to 2.5sec.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     90. Dev Note: Small change to give the S variant more visible benefits when compared to the standard Gauss Rifle.

Dev Note: Stacking HVA on top of this weapon makes it the highest projectile velocity assault rifle in the game. The forward grip benefit can be stacked with an optional forward grip for heavy horizontal recoil reductions.

Dev Note: We keep the laser sight benefits in exchange for the reduced bullet velocity here, allowing it to equip non-laser rail attachments and replace the impulse underbarrel if desired.

NC6A GODSAW (NC LMG)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Crouchwalk moving hipfire cone of fire from 4 to 3.75.

Dev Note: Very few changes made here, as the availability of attachments will push an already solid weapon just a bit further.

The Brawler (NC Shotgun)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Magazine size from 8 to 10.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Short reload speed from 2.1sec. 2.6sec.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            103. Dev Note: Expansion of magazine size with a small reload bump blends the Mauler and Sweeper's proficiencies. These changes take place on top of the sweeping shotgun changes mentioned above.

The Executive (NC Sidearm)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Removed integrated Suppressor.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Max damage from 200 to 222.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               104. Dev Note: Novel bump to the max damage range in exchange for the mag size reduction, and access to Disruptor ammunition. With the bumped damage and changes to Disruptor ammunition, you can stay above a 167 damage model and retain three-tap headshot potential in spite of that.

Tempest (NC SMG)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Removed integrated HVA.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Removed integrated Forward Grip.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  105. Dev Note: The "long range" benefits (and drawbacks) of this weapon have been removed, but can still be opted into through attachments.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * Reserve ammunition from 50 to 60.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       128. Dev Note: The adjustments to this weapon are on top of the overall changes to shotguns detailed elsewhere. The main draw of this weapon now becomes the semi-auto stat base being given automatic fire capabilities.

T1A Unity (TR Assault Rifle)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Now has access to the Underbarrel Cure Grenade Launcher by default.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * Removed integrated Soft Point Ammunition.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          129. Dev Note: The attachment access and innate forward grip benefits (that can be stacked with another forward grip) set this weapon apart from its predecessor. Unity is also the only TR assault rifle capable of equipping Heavy Mags in the ammo slot to increase its magazine size beyond the initial 40 rounds.

TRAC-Shot (TR Carbine)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * Now has access to the Underbarrel Impulse Grenade Launcher by default.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * Reduced max-damage range from 15m to 10m.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             130. Dev Note: The TRAC-Shot keeps its built-in laser in exchange for a minor penalty to projectile velocity, and a variety of non-laser attachment options.

T9A "Butcher" (TR LMG)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Ammo capacity from 450 to 600.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * Removed integrated Laser Sight.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                131. Dev Note: Extended magazines doubles the weapon's ammo, giving it the largest LMG magazine size in the game. This is also the only high rate of fire LMG to have access to KCAP ammunition, among other options.

Shuriken (TR SMG)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Short reload from 2.7sec. to 2.5sec.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Long reload from 3.5sec. to 3.2sec.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Removed integrated HVA.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Removed integrated Forward Grip.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   132. Dev Note: The "long range" benefits (and drawbacks) of this weapon have been removed, but can still be opted into through attachments. We kept the 40 round magazine, and reduced the reload slightly to make it more manageable. This innate extended magazine can now be stacked with the optional rail attachment to bring it up to 50 rounds total.

Looking Forward
Hey there. If it seems like this update is a bit light (outside of all these wicked dope cosmetics,) it's because we've been heads down working on a larger update that we'll be talking about in a Dev Letter next week. As a reminder of what we've got planned for this year (and when you're likely to see these features,) here's a link to the roadmap article: https://www.planetside2.com/news/roadmap-2022. All of that is still 100% on track at the moment, but you never know what the future holds... Except these updates. It holds all these updates. Here's a shot of the New Conglomerate's new empire-specific basilisk variant to placate that curious hunger.
-Wrel, Lead Designer
We're currently conducting rolling zone restarts on the PC Live servers. Any zone that is successfully restarted (which takes place when a zone is locked, when a zone is brought down manually, or when a zone crashes,) will receive the following updates.
--


Spawn System
We're rolling back some of the spawn-related changes made prior to the Oshur update. This brings back use of the Spawn Priority system, with a notable change that moves squad beacon respawns to a 10 second cooldown, opposed to the 15 second cooldown it used prior to the update. This also corrects the instant spawn beacon and beacon-blinking bugs that were introduced with the Oshur update itself.                                 


All PC servers will be offline for the following update, Feb. 09, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CET), downtime is expected to last up to two hours.

Spawn System
Some quick thoughts here toward the end: Feedback regarding the recent spawn changes has shown some unnecessary frustration on the non-Oshur continents. We're going to take a look at the controls and see if we can make improvements for a future update. Some features (like Reinforcements Needed and Join Combat) aren't as helpful as we anticipated they'd be with these changes, and in general the movement around the map is a bit too restrictive on the continents that have lots of bases.


The worst case scenario is that we can revert back to the Spawn Priority system in place prior to Oshur's release, but we'd prefer not to do that as that system tends to create significant server performance bottlenecks with its existing implementation. We'll be sure to message out when we've got updates to share.


Thanks folks.

Oshur Launch Thoughts
Hey there, just wanted to take a moment to remark on how amazing the reception to Oshur has been so far. It's rare to see this level of excitement and (dare I say) satisfaction with the gameplay to come out of an update. While there's still plenty of work to be done on the continent and its systems, the comments regarding how reminiscent Oshur is of PlanetSide 2's early glory, have been heartening and much appreciated.


There are certainly folks who don't have an interest in the type of gameplay being fostered on the continent, and that's totally valid. We sought to create an logistics heavy, strategy rich, and combined arms experience with Oshur, and the groundswell of support makes it seem like we landed pretty close to that mark. So thank you all for giving us (and Oshur) a chance, and we'll be keeping an eye out for more feedback as things become less new and shiny, and the meta of the continent starts to settle.

Other interlinks should receive teleporters when there's time.

Oshur Launch Thoughts
Hey there, just wanted to take a moment to remark on how amazing the reception to Oshur has been so far. It's rare to see this level of excitement and (dare I say) satisfaction with the gameplay to come out of an update. While there's still plenty of work to be done on the continent and its systems, the comments regarding how reminiscent Oshur is of PlanetSide 2's early glory, have been heartening and much appreciated.


There are certainly folks who don't have an interest in the type of gameplay being fostered on the continent, and that's totally valid. We sought to create an logistics heavy, strategy rich, and combined arms experience with Oshur, and the groundswell of support makes it seem like we landed pretty close to that mark. So thank you all for giving us (and Oshur) a chance, and we'll be keeping an eye out for more feedback as things become less new and shiny, and the meta of the continent starts to settle.

Welcome to the Isles of Oshur
A new, massive-scale continent makes its way to PlanetSide 2 for the first time since 2014. The tropical isles of Oshur are reminiscent of a time before the Auraxian war, where research and exploration were the most valued pursuits, and the factions weren't fully divided.


   



Something for Everyone
Oshur was designed with an emphasis on logistics and diversity of gameplay. The towering Trident Relays necessitate air support and quick responses, the lattice has deliberate and strategic cutoffs for squad and platoon leaders to pursue, the beachheads and mid-field bases carve a meaningful role for construction; the open savannahs, sandy beaches, and tropical jungles foster vehicle battles and heavy armor usage; and the hand-crafted designer-driven bases create unique and learnable gameplay spaces for hardened infantry veterans. With this new island battleground, there is something to enjoy no matter your style of gameplay.


   



Exodus Flotilla
The expedition to Oshur took place aboard the new Exodus-class Fleet Carriers. Unlike traditional maps, there are no Warpgates on Oshur, and this flotilla of heavily armed fleet carriers will become your new base of operations. Enemy vehicles that stray too close will be shot out of the sky by the shipboard Particle Projection Cannon.


   





Water Mechanics
As a part of a massive undertaking, we've completely changed how water works in PlanetSide 2. Every vehicle, infantry, and projectile interaction has been re-engineered to accommodate these new mechanics.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Wheeled Vehicles putter along the surface.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Infantry and treaded vehicles prowl the ocean floor.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Projectiles that enter the water are hit with heavy drag.
Indar, Amerish, Hossin, and Esamir will all be retrofitted with these new water mechanics at a later date (so don't dip your toes into that frozen river just yet.)


   



Underwater Weapons
Most traditional weapons won't fire while submerged, but special equipment has been added to ease the transition.
Three new underwater rifles and one underwater pistol are now available to access by various means.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * UBR-100 Frogman - Unlocked by completing the first tier of the Conquest Oshur directive.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * UBP-1 Starfish - Unlocked by completing the Distant Shores campaign.
   



New Facilities
Interlink Outpost
Constructed as early communication hubs for research on the islands and out at sea, the Interlinks are single-point infantry-capture bases with a close-quarters arena and multiple entrances for attackers.
Controlling an Interlink Outpost counts toward Empire Strength on the continent.


   



Trident Relay
These massive spires jutting from the water's surface are only enterable from their airpads located high above. Three symmetrical entrance-ways provide an airport-style atmosphere to fight through.
Controlling a Trident Relay counts toward Empire Strength on the continent, and allows for lattice cutoffs deep into enemy territory.


   



Distant Shores, Chapter 02
Nascent Expeditions has finally cleared the path toward Oshur, and the Empires are maneuvering to gain a foothold. The last chapter of the Distant Shores campaign will be made available Jan. 27.


   



New Directives
Oshur Collections - A new "Collections" tab can be found in the Directives page. Our first Collections directive asks you to recover the lost dog tags of those who died during the evacuation of Oshur.


   



Conquest - Oshur - In the "Strategic" tab, a new directive line dedicated to the war for Oshur has been added. Unlock the new UBR-100 Frogman by completing the first tier, and the (very special) Paradise Camo at Master tier, reserved for only the most hardened veterans.


   





Oshur Auto-Unlock Dates
To celebrate the launch of Oshur, we'll have certain windows where Oshur will auto-unlock itself. Outside of these days, the continent will remain in the normal rotation. We can enable or disable this functionality without downtime based on demand. The goal here is to allow everyone to experience the continent immediately while its new, while avoiding the burnout of the same map 24/7.


The current auto-unlock schedule is: Wednesday, Jan. 26 through Sunday, Jan. 30

Spawn System
We've stepped away from the Spawn Priority system from 2019, as it ended up providing too much freedom in later iterations, and have opted for something closer to the spawn system in 2018 with additional flexibility. Overall this constrains movement around the map slightly, which should help reduce the speed of the redeploy meta, and (ideally) emphasize vehicle's power to transport players. Additionally, Squad Beacons no longer have increased delays on spawn times, which, on top of increased access to Spawn Beacons over the years, is a pretty considerable boon to coordinated squad play.




Construction Changes
We've made some quality of life changes to make construction a bit easier to engage with, and made some adjustments to Routers that should bring "Router Bases" closer to the front lines.

Dev Note: These changes reduce the damage output and overall uptime of the weapon across all platforms.


Lodestar Prototype
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Nanite cost from 500 to 450.

Dev Note: The added health while deployed, and the lowered nanite cost should make this vehicle a bit more worthwhile as a deployable spawn option.


Wasp Prototype
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Cortium cost from 400 to 300.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Nanite cost from 350 to 250.
Dev Note: This cost reduction puts the Wasp on par with the normal Valkyrie to increase its accessibility a bit.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Projectile now despawns after 15 meters.
Dev Note: This is an experimental change meant to make the tradeoffs between the standard knife and Amaterasu more even.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * A new HUD compass has been added to the top center of the screen. This compass relays cardinal directions as well as heading, and can be disabled in the Interface Settings menu.

Looking Forward
Welp, it's finally here. A new large-scale continent, 7 (almost 8) years later, complete with totally new mechanics, a big emphasis on some early-days gameplay, and... just so, so much. The team did an amazing job bringing all this craziness to fruition, and judging by the excitement in testing, you're more than ready to explore something fresh. Thank you to all the folks who took time to test, and especially those who filled out the feedback form. That sort of thing helps more than you'd probably expect. There's no doubt that we've got some hotfixes to follow up with here, but even from the first playtest weekend to the second it seemed like we knocked out most of the major issues in record time. Tomorrow's update (which we'll release to PTS tonight,) should show off the progress we've made tightening up the loose ends.


To get everything back into perspective, this year we'll move into ten (10) years of PlanetSide 2, an absolutely insane milestone, and we'd like to do it big. It's a pretty exclusive club for games that stay in active development that long, and we're going to continue building on the foundation we've laid for years to follow. Earlier this month I mentioned that we'd be showing off a roadmap, and that's still the case, though it'll probably land here in February, instead of the late January I was looking for. Once we're past the craziness that is this update, we'll be looking forward to sharing some of what's on the docket for 2022.


Thanks all.

Auraximas is Upon Us!
A snowy Sanctuary heralds the beginnings of Auraximas, a holiday tradition for Auraxians young and old. With this festive season comes Snowmen-littered battlefields, a limited-time holiday directive, gift-giving missions, and special items available in the Depot.

Developer's Foreword
Hey there, everyone. I wanted to take a moment to thank you, the players, for a wonderful year of PlanetSide 2.


About this time last year, we mentioned during our last Livestream that 2021 would be all about shoring up cracks in the foundation. When I look at the systems we now have in place or have revisited; the major, multi-year bugs we've resolved; and the loads of quality of life features we've added; the progress that we've made toward that goal was substantial. That said, there have been plenty of challenges throughout: from high level departures of team members at the start of the year; to running into massive, unforeseen issues with key updates; to just trying to re-establish our footing, content cadence, and balance all the hats some of us are trying to wear. This year has certainly been an interesting ride, and no doubt you have all felt that to some degree as well.


The other public thank you I have is to my team here at Rogue Planet. This team has been putting in the effort every day, and I'm extremely grateful and fortunate to have access to all of their talent and dedication. It's important to remember that the game we make is unlike anything else on the market, and thousands of players enjoy shooting each other in the face each and every day. Sometimes it can be difficult to see, remember, or accept that joy when we're heads down trying to get updates out the door, but it's always there, and it's because of all of you. So, thank you too, team.


-Wrel, Lead Designer

Campaign 02, Distant Shores, Begins Now!
Our second-ever campaign, Distant Shores is now Live. Learn more about what Oshur once was, and the preparation needed to return.
   



We've made changes to the Campaign and Chapter UI to facilitate some new functionality with Campaigns.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * The first is that Chapter 01 will now be playable, even if Chapter 02 has already started. Though Chapter 01 must still be completed first.

Members still receive access to each Chapter for free.
These changes bring us a little closer to an eventual long-term goal of allowing old, "archived" Campaigns to remain playable or be brought back after they've expired.


New cosmetics, faction specific abilities, and prototype vehicle configurations will be available through the campaign.
   

Oh, that little guy? I wouldn't worry about that little guy.


A Note Regarding The Shattered Warpgate, on PS4
Due to hardware limitations, we're unable to bring the last chapter of The Shattered Warpgate to PS4 in good conscience. However, to reward the folks who were able to complete either the first or second chapter of Campaign 01, we will be giving all of the Chapter and Campaign completion rewards to your characters upon login. PS4 players will receive these rewards, and be able to partake in the Distant Shores campaign, after the update hits Live on that platform.

Koltyr
We're re-adjusting our goals for Koltyr based on player feedback. The main problem we're addressing with the changes below is that the zone is available too often, and for extended periods of time. This is an issue that affects some servers more than others. We'll be using Koltyr less like a holding pen for off-hours combat, and put it forth more as a change of pace that can occur during off-peak hours.

Dev Note: The changes above reel in the crossbow's effective range slightly, and increases the tradeoffs of certain attachments. In general, the weapon should require more precision to use effectively, and will no longer be capable of one-shot kills against non-Infiltrator classes. We'll continue to monitor the crossbow's performance and take action as needed.

Koltyr
We're re-adjusting our goals for Koltyr based on player feedback. The main problem we're addressing with the changes below is that the zone is available too often, and for extended periods of time. This is an issue that affects some servers more than others. We'll be using Koltyr less like a holding pen for off-hours combat, and put it forth more as a change of pace that can occur during off-peak hours.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Koltyr now enters the continent lock rotation when the server-wide population is less than 200 players.

It's possible that the large continent unlock limit comes down further, or is removed altogether in the future.

Looking Forward
While bigger features tend to be easier to talk about, I wanted to call out our heavy emphasis on quality of life, bug fixing, and general improvements, particularly in the last few updates. Over the years a lot of the improvements you're seeing now have been on our to-do list in some form or another, and it's traditionally been a bit difficult to justify the resource spend required to work on items like these. What's changed is two-fold. One, our team continues to grow, and has been acquiring some great talent lately. And two, is that it's just been more of a goal for us this year.


This year has been committed to, in a lot of ways, shoring up what I feel has been a cracked foundation so that building atop it can be done with confidence. Ages-old bugs are getting resolved (speculative fix in for the ghost-shell reload is being reviewed right now!,) graphics are being consistently improved upon (thanks to new tech and art techniques,) and performance seems to be going the right direction as well (though this one is a constant balancing act.) With a little luck and a lot of effort, the rest of this year will be amazeballs. As something fun for the folks reading here toward the end, Test Server will be updated with a new Light Assault tool experiment once the update goes out. May never see the light of day, but it's been pretty fun to toy around with.


Thanks everyone, happy almost-almost-Halloween.

Back to Basics
This update contains a massive push toward a better starting experience for new players. Everything from character creation, to the tutorial, to default loadouts, to the player's first "real" combat, to quality of life has been revisited.




Character Create
We've completely overhauled the character create and character selection screens. New UI, audio, faction introductions, FX and lighting all combine to enrich a player's introduction to our world.
   

   





New Tutorial
When looking at learning curve (or cliff?) of PlanetSide 2, we tried to isolate the lessons that could not only introduce players to the gameplay basics, but also help them understand and reinforce behaviors they'd be engaging in often. Capturing and defending bases, switching classes to adapt to situations, checking the map, and learning how to identify fights were among them. The new tutorial attempts to take all of these lessons and create a walkthrough that feels cohesive, and helps connect the player to the feeling of our game using mock battles with squads of NPCs fighting each other.
   





Post-Tutorial
We've added new "faction embassies" to the Sanctuary neutral zone. After completing the tutorial, the player lands here first to unlock some equipment, and head down to the planet's surface where they'll be able to speak to new "Field Commander" NPCs located in the upstairs room of each faction's Warpgate. We use this as a bridge to the game world, and help the player transition to their first major battle. The mission system guides much of this experience, creating short, achievable goals within the sandbox.


   





Default Equipment
We've made some tweaks to which equipment new players get at the start of the game. A couple of the areas we wanted to address were the lack of infantry anti-air in the earlier stages of the game, the unwieldy nature of certain starter weapons, and the lack of default vehicle equipment. Those changes will be listed further down in the Infantry and Vehicles sections of these notes.


Various QoL and NPE Improvements
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * Classes each have a "coversheet" that conveys the class's intended functions, specialties, and abilities.

Colorblind Accessibility
In an effort to improve our accessibility to colorblind gamers, we've added some new options under the graphics setting. Enabling colorblind filters will modify the colors of the 3d world to help account for Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, and Achromatopsia. You can adjust the "amount" and "strength" of the color adjustments to find what works best for you.
   



There are also some existing features worth bringing up while we're here. Faction-specific map and HUD indicators can be defined in the interface settings for better readability. Squad indicator colors can also be customized from the squad tab, and orbital strike and Sunderer no-deploy volumes can also be recolored.
   



Zones and Alerts
High-Pop (Conquest) Alerts
When a continent has more than 800 players on it, a "Conquest" Alert will immediately fire off that uses the same rules of a typical Meltdown.
For the third-party scripters out there, these are the alert IDs used for those events.

Dev Note: We've restructured missions to allow for more control over your rewards, and provide more options to free players. All currencies can be found in the non-member missions, so regardless of what you're looking for, be it more A7, Certs, or ISO, you'll be able to earn it daily. Members-only missions tend to have higher currency payouts overall. The "extra" rewards from missions, the weapons and boosts, were removed from the dailies, though it's possible these sorts of things return as rewards for holidays or in another fashion.


Graphics Improvements
Lighting Falloff
We've updated our lighting volumes to use a different kind of falloff. Moving from our previous quadratic light falloff to a (mostly) linear falloff model softens how "hot" the center of the lighting volume is, and reduces how sharply the light diminishes over range. The quadratic falloff we were using prior to this update made it more difficult (and expensive) to light interior spaces, as we needed to use more, smaller lights with higher intensities to fill the volume of space. The new falloff technique provides us with more control over lighting environments in the future, and softens the current lighting in-game to balance out the harsh extremes.


New Lighting in Menus
We've started using new lighting in the character select, character create, infantry, and vehicle loadout screens that provides more depth to our character models (and looks better all around.)


Shadow Quality
This is more of a fix than an update. We identified a change from a few years ago that essentially knocked every shadow quality level down by one. "Ultra" shadows, as an example, weren't really the intended Ultra shadows, and it was never reachable in the in-game settings menu, but was still possible to set in the UserOptions.ini. With this update, players' shadows will be bumped up a level, so you may need to adjust your shadow quality settings again once you are in-game.


Additionally, we've made some improvements to shadows to reduce the amount of artifacting that takes place on sheer edges during certain times of day. Current on Live, versus the Updated version (don't mind the bullet holes.) Both are at the same spot on Esamir, at the same time of day.

Looking Forward
There's a lot going behind the scenes in this update, especially in terms of tech. Things that you'd expect we'd be able to do, like get multiple GUI models to display on the character create screen at the same time, or have actual particle effects in the background were entirely new functionality and exploration for us. (And no, the old-old character create screen did not have particle effects, that was a flash-based animation that faked it pretty well.)


Doing the new tutorial required loads of scripting on top of new code hooks (you'll still find some quirkiness we need to clean up,) and even things like the "glass" that overlooks the void of space in the starting room is a new kind of shader that culls objects behind it so that all you see is the sky file.


The work for this update had both fun and frustration as we explored uncharted territory. All of which will be beneficial in the future.


So what are we looking at next? There's definitely some more cleanup and stretch goals we'd like to work through for the NPE portion of this update, and some of the features that were in development (Munitions Pouch background reload, Koltyr as a low-pop continent, and large continents spinning down when populations can't support them,) were cut from this initial launch so that we can finalize them. The ones mentioned above will likely be in the next hotfix.


After that, we'll be moving right along into October. Halloween should be pretty fun, if relatively low-key. This will give us time to work on our 9th anniversary release. Feels like it's just around the corner.


Anywho. Exciting times.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * Tank Shell resist (type 7) from -400 to -250.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * Flak resist (type 12) from -150 to -125.
Dev Note: This prevents the Dervish from getting one-shot by the Vanguard's Titan AP, bringing it to critical health instead. Composite Armor keeps the vehicle above critical health in this scenario. The increased flak resistance accounts for the vehicle's larger profile and limited capability to engage ground targets.

"Alright, but why are they here? We've never had problems on the station before."
"With those reports of employees going missing, can't say I blame them for cranking up the security."
"It makes me feel uneasy. They seem so... lifeless, and I've never seen them talk to anyone."

_Integration
The robotic fourth-faction re-emerges with advanced technology, new equipment, and shifting allegiances. In the _Integration update, we've released two new vehicles, 16 new vehicle weapons, 35 new infantry weapons, and 11 new directive trees for NSO players to pursue. On top of that, the NSO faction has become FREE TO ALL PLAYERS.


Unlocking NSO
Visiting Sanctuary with a BR20+ character will provide you with a mission to learn more about the Nanite Systems Operatives faction. Completing that mission will flag your account with access to the NSO faction, and you'll be able to create NSO characters from there on out.


Pre-existing accounts can log in with any BR20+ characters, or an NSO character of any Battle Rank, and still receive this mission.


Welcome, Freelancers
An NSO character without membership enters the "Freelance" status. A Freelancer will be assigned to the lowest populated faction on the continent to help them turn the tides of battle. Changing continents will reassign you as needed.


Freelancers are unable to create or join Outfits, and will need to select a "Home Faction" to do so.


Choosing a Home Faction
Players with All Access Memberships will be able to select a Home Faction by talking to a new NPC, Emerson, on Sanctuary. Aligning yourself with the Vanu Sovereignty, New Conglomerate, or Terran Republic, will allow you to create, join, and manage an Outfit within that empire.


You can also enter into a Freelance state on Sanctuary at any time, even while in an Outfit, and you won't be kicked. While fighting for an opposing faction, however, you won't have access to War Assets, Outfit communication, or representation. You can disable this state on Sanctuary as well.


If All Access membership lapses, you'll be dropped into the Freelance state mentioned above until membership is reinstated. You won't be kicked from an Outfit you're currently a part of if this occurs.


Lastly, if you ever want to shift faction allegiances, you can leave your current Outfit, assign yourself to a new Home Faction, and join an Outfit there instead.


Existing NSO Outfits
With this update we begin winding down support for "factionless" NSO Outfits. This summer we'll be providing a window for those Outfits to move to a Home Faction of their choice, and keep their members intact. This change requires additional tech to be created, and the timeline for that is still TBD. During this timeframe NSO Outfits will be unable to use War Assets, cannot recruit new members, and will adhere to other Freelance rules. Outfits can always be disbanded and reformed within a Home Faction to bypass the wait.




   





Arsenal Overhaul
NSO has become more defined as a faction with the introduction of new vehicles, weapons, and equipment.


Dervish Heavy Fighter
The Dervish is a two-seat vehicle that sacrifices agility for durability. The pilot operates nose-mounted forward guns, while the second seat is devoted to a top-gunner with a swiveling turret. This vehicle operates primarily as an air superiority fighter, and has limited ground support capabilities.

Lightning Grenade(Campaign Item)

Dev Note: We've removed rumble seat repairs to create clearer, more predictable vehicle balance. A lack of rumble-seat repairs should weaken the Harasser's ability to escape to a small degree, and slow down the pacing for this vehicle. The vehicle most impacted by this change will likely be the Valkyrie, as it will need to fly closer to the ground instead of being as brazen in the air. We've compensated to a small degree by allowing the Valkyrie to use the Engineer's Aircraft Synergy passive, but we'll be monitoring to see if additional changes are necessary to keep the Valkyrie relevant and fun.

Looking Forward
This iiiiiiiiis probably the largest update in the game's history, or a strong rival to it. Feels a little weird to say since it's not nearly as flashy as Escalation, or quite as fundamental as Construction... but the sheer scope of this update is massive for almost every department.The _Integration update will impact all players either directly or indirectly, and makes good on what we set out to do when the faction originally released in 2019.


When we delivered the first progress update, the numbers were a bit lower than where they sit now. Here's what we ended up with (with some categories changed from the original reveal.) Two new vehicles; 11 new directive trees; 16 new vehicle weapons; 35 new infantry weapons; 10+ new UI screen updates, reticles, and HUD overlays; 130+ new sound effects, music, stingers, and vocals; 260+ new particle effects and lighting elements; and a whole bunch of adds and ends along the way.


The next stop for us is rolling into the New Player Experience, as this is the year of revisiting, refining... reforging? The target would be to have something of substance released toward the end of summer, with some smaller updates in between.


Thanks for the continued support folks.

Celebrating 18 Years of PlanetSide
On May 20, we commemorate the 18-year legacy of PlanetSide from its initial release in 2003.


   



Double Experience Event
ALL PLAYERS will receive DOUBLE EXPERIENCE from May 20 - May 23.


A relic of the past?
FL-34 ran across some old equipment while cleaning out his shop. Make sure to visit him on Sanctuary.


NS Scorpion - 1000 Certs / 799 DBC
Over the past few years we've been integrating classic weapons and armor from the original game into the world of PlanetSide 2. This year brings another new (old) weapon to the fore.


The NS Scorpion rocket launcher fires a distance-detonated airburst that rains explosive bomblets upon enemy infantry and vehicles below. This weapon will require the user to learn the feel and timing of each shot, and has a high skill cap to get the most use out of it.


   





New items in the Depot
From May 20 - May 31, you can also visit the Depot for classic weapons and armor, solid faction camos, limited-time bundles, and a sleek new Punisher variant.


NS-66 Punisher SE - 1499 DBC
This gold-trimmed NS-66 Punisher also comes with gold optics and attachments, and contributes to Exceptional IV directive progress.
   





More in the Depot
Offerings from previous years will also be available in the Depot.

Looking Forward
Smallish update here (yet still loads of work,) with the big NSOverhaul update being slated for the next major release. The tech developed for the Scorpion's airburst is pretty powerful, and gives us a lot of room to do cool things with in the future. During the development of the new tech, the team was able to refactor old code that was either messy, or engineered to be overly explicit in its function, and also brought to light some low key issues that were addressed at the same time. These sorts of things aren't likely to be noticed in normal gameplay, but matter behind the scenes when it comes to overall health of the code base. Anywho, looking forward to see what craziness you all can pull off with the new weapon.

Chapter 03 BEGINS
The empires of Auraxis celebrate as three new Containment Sites come online on Esamir, neutralizing the storm that has battered the continent for months. Nanite Systems continues to search for Foster, their former representative on Sanctuary, who disappeared after attempting to use the Esamir recovery effort to hide mistakes of the past. Meanwhile Archivist Dolan, an earlier victim of Foster's ambition, exerts her influence from afar to earn favor with the Black Market vendors and Nanite Systems Operatives.

    An unassuming black pistol rests on the large, polished desk, as if part of the décor. He folded his hands neatly.


    "May I offer you a drink?" I declined.


    An assistant leaves the room and shuts the door quietly behind her.


    "I understand the position you are in now may seem unfavorable, but I'd ask you to keep in mind who your creditors were prior." A lump formed in my throat.


    "After you have completed the program, your debts will be forgiven. Your family will be looked after in the event that you fail." I glanced down at the papers in front of me.

    Chapter 03 - Campaign Finale
    Auraxis celebrates the construction of the first major facility built terrestrially since the war began, a representation of each faction's combined efforts to quell the instability on Esamir.


    With the last chapter of our campaign, the roaming energy storm on Esamir has dissipated, now controlled by the new "Containment Sites" that have been constructed. These massive underground facilities bring with them new challenges and gameplay never before seen in PlanetSide 2.


    For the PC, this last chapter of The Shattered Warpgate campaign will start May 05, and run through June 30.


    While the Campaign will eventually end, Esamir is forever changed, and the Containment Sites are here to stay... or at least until another catastrophe.


     


    Containment Site (New Facility)
    The Containment Site is a large scale facility new to Esamir in Chapter 03 of The Shattered Warpgate campaign. There are multiple stages of combat where soldiers will fight around and through the facility. Vehicle combat is emphasized outside of the facility, requiring the destruction of multiple weakpoints to bring down gate shields barring entry. Within the hub of the facility, a destroyable SCU will disable defender spawn locations on the first floor of the facility. Attackers then descend into the lower regions of the facility, fighting for capture points held in the Botany and Reliquary wings, as well as within the Tempest Capacitor. The Botany and Reliquary capture points also activate a spawn rooms for attackers within the facility, allowing them to establish a tenuous foothold within the base. During the fight for capture point control, defenders spawn within the sub-level, and must fight their way back toward the surface to re-secure the facility.


     




    Features
    This new facility houses a variety of gameplay elements that are new to Auraxis.


        Gate Shield Weakpoints - The hangar bay doors preventing passage into the center of the facility must first be destroyed before a shield will fall. There are three gate shields that operate independently, and are impervious to small arms damage.
        Upper Level SCU - Unlike most Spawn Control Units, this one can be destroyed through heavy weapons fire or overloaded. Overloading the SCU will prevent defenders from spawning on the upper level.
        Guide Paths - Making your way through the heart of the facility is assisted with guide paths that light the way toward each capture point.
        Tempest Siphon - A massive conduit channels the sky's energy into the core of the facility. While the siphon is active, both this conduit and the Tempest Capacitor rooms are deadly. Defenders can turn the siphon on, while attackers can turn it off, using a console on the mid level. If defenders turn the Tempest Siphon on, it will also immediately take back the capture point held within the Tempest Capacitor room.
        Electrical Room - While the siphon is active, this room becomes charged with energy and shields prevent access (for your safety). The capture point within also reverts to the defender's ownership when this room is active.
        Botany Wing - Planters cultivating the new flora of the Shattered Warpgate can be found in the Botany Wing. These plants act as soft cover that can be destroyed, and regrows rapidly.
        Reliquary Wing - Important research is locked away in the Reliquary Wing, and multiple shields block passage to the capture point. Destroyable locking mechanisms disable these shields.
        Attacker Spawns - Both the Botany Wing and Reliquary Wing capture points are tied to spawn points that only attackers will gain access to if secured.
        Vents - There are plenty of ways in and around the facility, including small passageways that offer risky alternative paths to your destination.


     
    A new lattice lane near to the Shattered Warpgate has unlocked, allowing you to fight through the ruins of Stillwater Watch.

    Implants
    Symbiote


        Fixed an issue that prevented Symbiote from gnawing at health pools after redeploying.


    Phylactery
    This implant has been reworked to move away from the experience counting trigger, and instead does the following:


        Now allows you to self-revive once after being revived 3 times in a row by allies.
        Using an equipment terminal, redeploying, or entering a vehicle will restart your counter.


    Heavyweight
    This implant has been reworked to give it a more worthwhile niche and more usability. Instead of the reduced bullet flinch and penalty to movement speed, the penalty has been removed, and it acts as mentioned below:


        Rank 01: 60% explosive camera shake reduction / Not affected by knockbacks caused by enemies or allies
        Rank 02: 65% explosive camera shake reduction / Not affected by knockbacks caused by enemies or allies
        Rank 03: 75% explosive camera shake reduction / Not affected by knockbacks caused by enemies or allies
        Rank 04: 95% explosive camera shake reduction / Not affected by knockbacks caused by enemies or allies
        Rank 05: 95% explosive camera shake reduction / Not affected by knockbacks caused by enemies or allies / Taking fall damage will cause a shockwave that knocks back nearby enemies (this portion is unchanged.)


    Misc. Changes, Fixes, and Additions


        Visual
            "God rays" have returned with this update. Having the "shadows" and "fog shadows" settings toggled on in the Graphical Settings menu will enable them.
            Heavy Assault shield visuals have been adjusted in first person to make them more visible.
            Fixed incorrect lighting colors on the infantry terminal.
            Bullet hole decals on Esamir rocks now match the color of the rock.
        Gameplay
            Tapping the crouch key for just a moment no longer instantly places you into a crouch on remote clients, you instead now smoothly transition. (This part is a bug fix.)
            The time to enter a crouch on remote clients has been lengthened and smoothed out. This change should make "crouch spam" as a technique less effective.
            Added First Time Events (tutorial slideouts on the right side of the screen) for many construction items and some class tools.
            A large number of props added in The Shattered Warpgate update are now allowed to clip into construction objects, bringing them in line with other props.
            Replaced the "S-AMS" reference with "Sunderer" when you're notified that your last Sunderer spawn is under attack.
            Fixed an issue preventing the Prowler from being pulled from a Heavy A.N.V.I.L.
            Thumper now deals 50% less indirect friendly fire damage.
        UI
            It's now more obvious on the HUD when an ability is active.
            Increased opacity of lattice links between regions contested by two opposing factions.
            Added a Back button to the Campaign pane timeline.
            The "Maximum Voice Channels" setting in the Audio menu has been renamed and description that more accurately reflects its functionality. This channel limits the total number of sound effects that can be playing at any given time.
            The default settings for maximum audio channels has been increased to 128 for PC (and 96 for PS4 once the update arrives.)
            Increased loading speed on the World Map UI, and continents can now be warped to before the globe has loaded.


     
    Volumetric fog lighting or "god rays" returned with this update.




    Looking Forward
    Feels like it's been forever since we've had a nice, juicy update to send out. This one has definitely been a bit of a learning experience from our side, and hopefully the wait will have been worth it. The new facility carries with it visual stylings that we can use elsewhere in the future, and has some gameplay experiments that we can integrate with other bases if they end up feeling as intuitive as we'd like them to be. One of the big aspects of the Containment Site's gameplay was trying to bring more "stages" to encounters, so that the gameplay felt more like the siege of a castle than hammering on a spawn room until a capture point flips. The base is meant to accommodate massive populations, and during our first public playtests we had more than 400 players in the same base on Saturday, and more than 500 in the same base on Sunday. Absolutely insane. Thank you to all of the folks who were able to come out and help with the testing, including the focus testing group who gave us targeted feedback behind the scenes. We'll be continuing to polish the remaining visuals of the facility after this release, and will look to squash any remaining bugs with following hotfixes.


    After this update, the majority of the team will shift toward working on the NSO update, while a smaller portion of the team will continue on with the New Player Experience that we have targeted for summer. For the new player experience update, we're looking to not only revamp the tutorial, but take a look a new player's experience more holistically. This means we'll be re-evaluating things like the map, the spawn system, how you find a squad or an outfit, what default equipment players have, how players figure out where to go, and so on. The intention is to get us into a better place to onboard new players before another large update hits toward the end of the year... you know, that one including a new continent.

                                                                                 All PC servers will come down for the following changes on Wednesday, March 31, at 6:00am PT (3:00pm CEST). Downtime for this update is expected to last up to 2 hours.


Unstable Warpgates
Addressed an issue where continents wouldn't attempt to stabilize when populations grew too rapidly. This issue was worked around on PC last week. All continents will now flow through the single-lane, multi-lane, and fully stabilized states as intended. Populations noted from last week's update are below.

Unstable Warpgates
Amerish, Esamir, Hossin, and Indar now have a "partially" stabilized state that creates additional territory lanes along the rim of the continent, in addition to the path in the center.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * "Partial" stabilization occurs at 100 players on the continent, or after 3 hours have passed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * "Full" stabilization occurs at 350 players on the continent, or after 5 hours have passed.
The intention behind these changes is to increase fight density on off-continents and during low-pop hours, and prevent ghost-capping of off continents. Previous changes went too far in this regard, and the partial stabilization state will allow for more combat areas.

Outfit Wars
We will be fixing an issue where extra Victory Points were assigned at the beginning of Playoffs Round 2, based on the Outfit's current rank.

Hey there, folks. We're experimenting with shorter update cycles on smaller fixes and features that we don't necessarily want to hold for a larger update. So you're going to start seeing small updates like this more often. Our main focus as a team is working on Chapter 03 and the NSO revamp, both of which are turning out to be pretty large updates at this point. On the 17th we're targeting getting the first look of Chapter 03 and the new facility to the public test server, so prepare for a large download.

Outfit Wars
We will be fixing an issue where extra Victory Points were assigned at the beginning of Playoffs Round 2, based on the Outfit's current rank. This bug didn't impact any placements going into the round, as the matches were calculated using the correct VP, and we'll be adjusting the VP to its proper values when this update goes Live.

The first Outfit Wars matches will take place either Friday or Saturday, and match times for this first round will become visible the morning of the 19th on each server. Subsequent matches will have about a week's worth of leadup with match times displayed, and the transition from Enlistment→First Round will be resolved in the next season.

Outfit Wars 2.0
The war returns, new and improved. The 2.0 release brings Outfit versus Outfit combat back to the asteroid belt of Desolation with the start of Alpha Cycle 03.


Outfit Wars is a tournament-style showdown where teams from each empire fight for control over ancient Vanu relics. Each team earns placement based on how well they perform, ultimately resulting in a showdown between the top Outfits at the end of the cycle.


A detailed breakdown of the phases and scoring can be found in this article: https://www.planetside2.com/news/ps2-outfit-wars-alpha-3-pts-january-2021

Alpha Cycle 03
This Outfit Wars alpha cycle will be our last before entering into full on seasons at a predictable cadence. There are 6 rounds total for Alpha Cycle 03, but we intend to move into 10 round cycles when seasons are in full swing, but that may change based on feedback.


Below is the schedule for each phase of Alpha Cycle 03.
Matches take place on either Friday or Saturday based on how many total outfits are in the round.
Match times are revealed at the beginning of each new round, (or at the end of a phase, in the case of Enlistment) and matches themselves take place around prime time.

The base has become inoperable, and will require maintenance before coming back online.

Additional tuning may need to occur, but the intention is to prevent low-pop continents from rotating too quickly.

War Assets
Made some minor adjustments to weights, crafting times, and costs to encourage use of some of the smaller assets, and bumped the cost of Orbital Strikes. We'll likely be taking another look at expeditions in the future.

Dev Note: Cortium Bomb is definitely seeing some meme use on Live, but being able to disarm it easily from any distance didn't create the tension it was originally intended to. Having this tool in the toolbox now means that players can intentionally create space, even in indoor fights, forcing a commitment from enemies while creating a mini-defense objective for allies. Allowing allies to disarm the device also reduces the possibility for trolling, and helps ensure that the device only gets placed when everyone is on the same page about its use. We'll be monitoring this one closely.

Dev Note: The way our engine works currently, is that resistances tend to dictate what audio you hear when damage is inflicted on you. Much of the damage over time dealt from incendiary weapons was using the common explosives resistance, which was meant for... well, explosives. So you'd periodically hear the "thoom, thoom, thoom," instead of a sizzle that'd be more indicative of your burning state. It does also present us with opportunities to use the burning damage type as a way to bypass some of the other resistances in the game, which helps further define a niche. Currently, incendiary's damage mirrors that of the common explosive, so no changes to the actual damage output of any of these effects, with the exception of protection provided by Flak Armor, which does not mitigate this damage type.

New Conglomerate MAX Weaponry
The changes below nudge the NC MAX's shotgun weaponry closer to VS and TR MAX in terms of overall viability. These shotguns continue to sacrifice damage per magazine and effective range for better burst damage in close quarters, but the penalties for doing so should be less severe now, and versatility should be improved slightly.

Tomorrow's update introduces potential performance improvements released on PTS last week. These code changes apply better multi-thread support when new trackable objects (like players, NPCs, or projectiles) are introduced within your proximity range. The impact for the player should result in less "server lag" in large-scale battles. We'll be monitoring live servers closely after the patch, so please let us know if you run into any issues (we'll leave this thread open for comments/feedback).

We have resolved our PS4 submission issue, all PS4 servers will come down on Wednesday, Dec. 16 at 8am PST (5pm CET) as originally scheduled for today's update.

Esamir Electrical Storm changes
We've made some pretty significant adjustments to the lightning storm that address the main pain points brought up by the playerbase.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Stormbolts that would normally "follow" players and vehicles no longer do so, and instead target the ground nearby.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Insulated Suit and Armor descriptions have been updated to remove references to bolts being "attracted" to you.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Deployed vehicles now receive only 2500 damage from overloading, instead of being destroyed outright.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Increased the radius in which a stormbolt impact does its minimum 50 damage, from 10m to 15m.
Overall, the storm bolts will be much easier to avoid for both players and vehicles, as they're very clearly telegraphed by the effects on the ground. Fights at a base should no longer die off when the storm arrives, as an overload is now much less detrimental for deployed Sunderers.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Daily mission versions of "Enabling Construction," "Continued Preparations," and "Crystal Stalker" now expire after 12 hours as intended.

Dev Note: In the most common combat situations, this is a buff.

Looking Forward
I don't usually do this segment for the smaller patch notes, but this one is full of changes and fixes for not only for Chapter 2 of the campaign, but some issues that have been around for years as well. Small on their own, but add up in the end, which is one of the themes we'll be bringing into 2021. Lots of refinements and fixes, as well content updates, big and small. Speaking of which, Auraximas is right around the corner. As far as the typical sales calendar goes, most of what we'd tend to have on offer during the holidays has already been available all year (and the daily item showcases didn't create much value for anyone, despite looking great on a calendar.) So this year, we'll be doing something a bit different by offering sales on specific bundles on the weekends, starting this Friday. We'll call out exactly what'll be going on sale when the time comes, so keep an eye on the @planetside2 Twitter account. In a couple of weeks we'll also be releasing a new Auraximas directive that will actually float into January 2021 a bit as well. I'll give another update once we're closer to the Auraximas release, which will contain the snowmen, holiday toys, the new directive, and some other goodies as well.

Dev Note: Direct damage adjustments here bring the Masamune's anti-vehicle potential closer to the Decimator's without usurping its role.


Standardized minimum blast radius of 0.35m to 0.5m. Impacted weapons below.

Esamir Electrical Storm changes
We've made some pretty significant adjustments to the lightning storm that address the main pain points brought up by the playerbase.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Stormbolts that would normally "follow" players and vehicles no longer do so, and instead target the ground nearby.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Deployed vehicles now receive only 2500 damage from overloading, instead of being destroyed outright.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Increased the radius in which a stormbolt impact does its minimum 50 damage, from 10m to 15m.
Overall, the storm bolts will be much easier to avoid for both players and vehicles, as they're very clearly telegraphed by the effects on the ground. Fights at a base should no longer die off when the storm arrives, as an overload is now much less detrimental for deployed Sunderers.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Fixed issues where various weapons' attachments would inherit armor camo in third person, but show the correctly applied weapon camo in first person.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Daily mission versions of "Enabling Construction," "Continued Preparations," and "Crystal Stalker" now expire after 12 hours as intended.

Descriptions updated to better relay what the ability does.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Regeneration Tier 5 implant's headshot benefit now heals 100 health over 2 seconds, instead of 50 instantly. Dev Note: In the most common combat situations, this is a buff.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Mani Lake Outpost's name no longer shows as Mani Lake Satellite on the map screen hover-over.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Improved the messaging for the Tempest Shield and abilities granted from the "Biological Warfare" mission to better convey what you're unlocking.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Improved the messaging for the Elysium campaign mission to better convey that you need to be near a Refinery to harvest crystals.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Blackheart, Heartstring, NS-357P now count as sidearms for the purposes of objectives that require sidearm kills, and implants like Vampire 5 that rely on sidearms to trigger them.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Improved the messaging for the "More than Scrap Metal" mission, noting that the player must be in the vehicle to earn credit. Dev Note: Having to sit in the Sunderer to earn credit outside of a squad isn't ideal, but unfortunately a proper fix would have broken the mission for players who currently were on them.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Reduced the number of Transport Assists needed for "More than Scrap Metal" from 5 to 3.

When 15 squadmates spawn into your Valkyrie, you should now receive a Squad Support ribbon the same as a Galaxy/Sunderer would.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Fixed an issue where using the Neuralizer Device on an abandoned vehicle wouldn't attach the particle effects to the correct spot.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * Removed an errant teleporter in The Traverse spawn room.

Looking Forward
I don't usually do this segment for the smaller patch notes, but this one is full of changes and fixes for not only for Chapter 2 of the campaign, but some issues that have been around for years as well. Small on their own, but add up in the end, which is one of the themes we'll be bringing into 2021. Lots of refinements and fixes, as well content updates, big and small. Speaking of which, Auraximas is right around the corner. As far as the typical sales calendar goes, most of what we'd tend to have on offer during the holidays has already been available all year (and the daily item showcases didn't create much value for anyone, despite looking great on a calendar.) So this year, we'll be doing something a bit different by offering sales on specific bundles on the weekends, starting this Friday. We'll call out exactly what'll be going on sale when the time comes, so keep an eye on the @planetside2 Twitter account. In a couple of weeks we'll also be releasing a new Auraximas directive that will actually float into January 2021 a bit as well. I'll give another update once we're closer to the Auraximas release, which will contain the snowmen, holiday toys, the new directive, and some other goodies as well.

PC servers will come down Friday, November 20, 2020, at 6am PST (3pm CET), for the game update below. Downtime is expected to last up to three hours.

The Shattered Warpgate - Chapter 02 Begins Nov. 20
You've learned all you can about the calamity, and Representative Foster from Nanite Systems has come up with a solution to deterioration of Esamir... but it will take some work, from all of us.
Chapter 2 carries with it entirely new events that move through the second stage of the story on Esamir, and includes new side missions, equipment, and faction-specific technology to unlock.
While Chapter 1 has come to a close, the items and currency you accrued with move with you into Chapter 2.

Looking Forward.
Been quite the whirlwind year for PlanetSide 2. With the increased team size, we were able to pull off some massive scale craziness well above and beyond what we've done traditionally, from Escalation and Outfit Wars to Campaigns and Missions. Behind the scenes, each of these updates were also great strides forward technologically, creating new tools and resolving issues that weren't visible to the community, but had hamstrung development efforts greatly in the past. The success of this year, and the systems we introduced along the way have also put us in a great place to start looking back at older elements of the game, systems that need heavy attention or revision. That will be one of our main focuses going into the new year. We'll be talking in more specifics about our initiatives for 2021 during the Livestream on www.twitch.tv/planetside2, so please be sure to join us at 11am PST.

When you pulled the vehicle, it deducted the proper discounted amount of nanites, but were gated from pulling the vehicle altogether until you met that base cost.
